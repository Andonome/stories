\chapter{Casting Rules}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Casters roll Charisma + Sphere at \tn[7].

  \textit{For example, a caster with Charisma +1 and Air +2, casting a first level Air spell would roll with a +3 Bonus.}
  \item
  Various things can increase the \gls{tn} -- especially when the spell's target resists!
  \item
  Casters can gain bonuses to their low-spheres from rare ingredients, when properly prepared.
  These bonuses count as if the caster had that higher level.

  Situations can also grant a bonus to high-spheres.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building spells}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Every spell starts by selecting one or more spheres.
  \item
  The caster then selects one of the four actions to apply to the element:
  \begin{description}
    \item[Wax]
    increases the target's potency, making water ripple and fires flare.
    \item[Wane]
    does the opposite, making the target diminish its basic nature.
    \item[Warp]
    twists the target's fundamental nature, making life take on unnatural forms, or bending space into solid item.
    \item[Witness]
    allows a single `yes/no' question about the target sphere.
  \end{description}
  These spells so far cost 1 \gls{mp}, but casters can add enhancements.
  \item
  Each Enhancement the casters add both increases its potency, and alters how the spell works.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Detailed]
    spells change appearance, or grant more information.

    \textit{Crumbling stone with a `detailed wane earth' spell may create a statue on the inside of the shattered rock, revealed by brushing off the debris.
    To `Witness Fate` could highlight those with 8 or more \glspl{fp}.}
    \item[Distant]
    spells outstretch the usual range, \emph{but} cannot be limited in their range.
    \item[Divergent]
    spells combine an extra sphere (low or high). The two spheres have the same   Enhancements, but can have separate targets.

    \textit{A spell to `wax water' can make a river bulge, so adding fire would make a spell to `wax water and fire'; as the river swells, a bonfire flares up.}
    \item[Duplicated]
    spells can affect many targets -- typically the number of targets equals the cost, squared.
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}
