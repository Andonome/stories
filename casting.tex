\chapter{Casting Rules}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Casters roll Charisma + Sphere at \tn[7].

  \textit{For example, a caster with Charisma +1 and Air +2, casting a first level Air spell would roll with a +3 Bonus.}
  \item
  Various things can increase the \gls{tn} -- especially when the spell's target resists!
  \item
  Casters can gain bonuses to their low-spheres from rare ingredients, when properly prepared.
  These bonuses count as if the caster had that higher level.

  Situations can also grant a bonus to high-spheres.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building spells}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Every spell starts by selecting one or more spheres.
  \item
  The caster then selects one of the four actions to apply to the element:
  \begin{description}
    \item[Wax]
    increases the target's potency, making fires burn bright, or water ripple.
    \item[Wane]
    does the opposite, making the target diminish its basic nature.
    \item[Warp]
    twists the target's fundamental nature, making life take on unnatural forms, or bending space into solid item.
    \item[Witness]
    allows a single `yes/no' question about the target sphere.
  \end{description}
  These spells so far cost 1 \gls{mp}, but casters can add enhancements.
  \item
  Each Enhancement the casters add both increases its potency, and alters how to spell works.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Distant]
    spells outstretch the usual range, \emph{but} cannot be limited in their range.
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}
