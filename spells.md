### Treacherous Torch
    (*Big Fire*)

A target torch, not far from the mage, explodes, causing 1D6-1 Damage to whoever holds it.

### Timid Flame
    (*Bizarre Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Skill**: Stealth, **TN**: 7, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

The fire begins to burn slowly, going through its fuel bit by bit.

    (*Bizarre Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Skill**: Crafts, **TN**: 7, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

The target torch or candle burns through its fuel in an instant, and with a flash of light.
Anyone wearing burning clothes makes an entertaining target - the fire inflicts 1D6 Damage, and they find themselves naked and covered in burns.

## Level 2

### Flame Bolt
    (*Big, Duplicated, Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Skill**: Projectiles, **TN**: 8, **Cost**: 2, **Range**: 7 Steps

A bolt of fire springs from the mage's hand, inflicting 1D6-2 Damage on anyone targeted.
If the spell targets a bow of any kind, the bowstring snaps.

### Spearlight
    (*Bizarre, Duplicated, Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Skill**: Crafts, **TN**: 8, **Cost**: 2, **Range**: 7 Steps
The caster focusses on a wooden item (such as a spear or broom), forcing it to catch fire and burn up within seconds.

Anyone holding the item must drop it or suffer 1D6-1 Damage.


## Level 3

### Phoenix Wings
    (*Big, Beautiful, Duplicated, Fire*)

A great bird, made of fire, appears and spreads its wings across a 2 step area (typically targeting two people).

Anyone who would be caught in the spell's wings can attempt to evade by using Speed + Athletics.

# Air

## Level 1

### Wind Blast
    (*Big Air*)
    **Spheres**: Air, **Skill**: Seafaring, **TN**: 7, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

The spell blasts the target back with air.
They then lose 3 AP minus their Strength.


### Mystery Door
    (*Bizarre Air*)
    **Spheres**: Air, **Skill**: Seafaring, **TN**: 7, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

A nearby patch of air turns into mist.
Mages typically use this spell to block doorways or windows.

Aiming arrows or spells at the feint shapes beyond suffers a -3 penalty.

## Level 2

### Whispering Wind
    (*Beautiful, Distant, Air*)
    **Spheres**: Air, **Skill**: Performance, **TN**: 8, **Cost**: 2, **Range**: 20 Steps

The caster gives a message to the wind, which then whispers the message to someone within range.
The message is so indistinct and garbled that the recipient won't hear much.

When NPCs hear the spell, the Judge should roll their Wits + Vigilance (TN 7) to pick up some basic meaning.
When PCs hear the spell, the Judge should tell the players some words which rhyme with the intended message.

While anyone can see the mage casting a spell, they will not hear the words to be whispered simply from the casting.

### Secret Whispers
    (*Beautiful, Discreet, Air*)
    **Spheres**: Air, **Skill**: Performance, **TN**: 8, **Cost**: 2, **Range**: 7 Steps

As with Whispering Wind, but none can see the mage casting the spell without a Wits + Vigilance roll, resisted by the caster's Dexterity + Larceny.


## Level 3

### Storm Blast
    (*Big, Beautiful, Duplicated, Air*)
    **Spheres**: Air, **Skill**: Performance, **TN**: 8, **Cost**: 3, **Range**: 8 Steps

The mage spins a massive cone of wind around 6 targets.
Each loses 3 AP.
