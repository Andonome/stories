### Treacherous Torch
    (*Big Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

A target torch, not far from the mage, explodes, causing 1D6-1 Damage to whoever holds it.

### Timid Flame
    (*Bizarre Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

The fire begins to burn slowly, going through its fuel bit by bit.
Anyone can touch the flame without taking damage, as long as they don't hold it for more than a few moments.

The fire continues spilling its light as usual.

### Waning Torch
    (*Bizarre Fire*)
    **Spheres**: Fire, **Cost**: 1, **Range**: 6 Steps

The target torch or candle burns through its fuel in an instant, and with a flash of light.
Anyone wearing burning clothes makes an entertaining target - the fire inflicts 1D6 Damage, and they find themselves naked and covered in burns.
