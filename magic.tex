\chapter{Witchcraft}

The spells from the \textit{Core Rules} each express a single formula, and spellcasters can use that formula to craft their own spells, or create \glspl{talisman}.
Those with the knack for it can craft spells on the fly, while others require weeks of practice and focus to create their own spells.

A spell's heart comes from a primitive sentence, usually left implied rather than spoken.
The actual language could express the spell as chatter, sign-language, theatre or song.

\section{Weaving Spells}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\index{Spheres}

\subsection{Step by Step}

\mapentry{Elemental Mana}

Every spell starts with an elemental Sphere -- Earth, Water, Fate, Air, and Fire.
Casters can pour a number of \glsentrylongpl{mp} into a spell, up to their level in that Sphere, and every \gls{mp} goes a long way.

Spellcasters have precisely four way to agitate the world.

\paragraph{Waxing}
spells encourage the element to express its basic nature.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Stone, or ice hardens, and sand clumps together into a solid mass;
  \item
  streams rush faster down hill, and even ale in a mug may begin to swirl and froth gently in an effort to escape to the ground;
  \item
  fate wraps its attentions on someone, increasing their \glspl{fp};
  \item
  air rushes round and up, violently;
  \item
  and fire burns.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Waning}
magic does the opposite -- it stifles, scatters, or reverses the element's essential nature.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Snow melts easily, and ice melts with a little effort (\gls{tn}~7-9).
  Stone puts up far more resistance, but skill and patience may soften slate to the consistency of thick, wet, clay (\gls{tn}~12-14).
  Metals provide far more resistance, and may prove impenetrable to casters without plenty of preparation and \pgls{boon} (\gls{tn} 16-20).

  More complex stuff, like wood, or flesh, does not respond to Earth mages -- true, elemental Earth has only one form, running through it.
  Even a metal alloy can raise a spell's \gls{tn} significantly.
  \item
  Water stagnates and evaporates.
  Small puddles and mugs of ale may vanish quickly (\tn[6] and 9)
  but a flowing river or loch always requires a spell large enough to cover a massive chunk of its body (and a roll at \tn[12]).
  \item
  Waning Fate does very little to the myriad wretches of \gls{fenestra}, who never had much chance to begin with.%
  \footnote{Most \glspl{npc} have no \glspl{fp}.}
  Those lucky enough to have luck to lose usually resist with \roll{Charisma}{Deceit}.
  \item
  Dead air stands still and milky, blocking vision (\tn[7]);
  and once smokey enough it begins to choke people.
  Underground, these spells can blind or kill (\tn[9]), but on a stormy mountain, casters will need to create a full cyclone%
  \footnote{See step \vref{magic:duplicated}.}
  of thick smoke or simply fail altogether (\tn[16]).
  \item
  Spells cannot destroy, but once a candle shrinks and scatters its energy, the fire dies a natural death (\gls{tn} 7).
  Hearth fires put up more of a fight (\gls{tn} 10), and torches made of pitch may grow dim.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Warping}
an element alters one of its fundamental aspects.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Twisted Earth may become brittle -- both extra-hard, and liable to shatter into sharp points.
  \item
  Water should want to spread out and down, and if that changes, it thickens into ice;
  or if its clarify fails, it can become poisonous, or even acidic.
  \item
  Warping Fate affects the \gls{gm}'s random encounters, sending them on loops, or bunching a week's encounters into a single day.%
  \footnote{Once \pgls{doula} curses someone, nobody wants to travel with them.  This is the real curse behind the spell, and doesn't even require a spell to be cast.}
  \item
  Air should be formless, but insistent witches can demand a few clear breaths of air stick close by, or coax mist into forming simple shapes.
  \item
  Blue flames, moving in slow motion, decorate the festivals every \gls{Laiquea}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Witnessing}
work differently to the other actions -- the caster stops speaking, and starts to listen.
No spell is cast, but a receptive attitude must be adopted throughout the entire body, and mind.
And despite no `casting' occurring, mana must flow out, in order to form a bond with an element which might lie in that direction.

When \pgls{pc} wants to Witness an element, the player must ask a `yes/no' question, which indicates what the \gls{pc} has attuned to.

Walls go a long way towards blocking anyone from Witnessing an element, which makes the activity close to pointless, at least with the spell's basic form.
The observer can look at a fire, and confirm that it is fire.
These spells become rather more useful once combined with spell `Descriptions'.

\mapentry{Descriptors}

Descriptors increase a spell's properties, giving it a longer range, or copying the spell across \pgls{area}.
Each Descriptor makes the effects more powerful, and makes every other Descriptor more powerful.

Pour a little more mana into a spell, and it blossoms quickly in one direction.
Give a little more to some other part of the spell, and both areas swell up even more.

The spell-patterns outlined above each cost 1~\gls{mp}.
Characters can spend a number of \glspl{mp} equal to their rating in a Sphere, so someone with Earth~2 can span \pgls{mp} to cast a \textit{Wax Air} spell (and push someone back with a blast of wind), or spend 2~\glspl{mp} to cast a \textit{Duplicated Wax Air} spell (and push many people back, with a more powerful blast of wind).

\paragraph{Detailed}
spells let you control the appearance and distinctions of a spell.
Where most spells have no more definition than one might expect of a gust of wind or stalagmite, \textit{Detailed} spells look like something.

\begin{boxtable}
  \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Visages}       \\
  \hline
      1          & A lumpy pile of substance. \\
      2          & A candle-flame which seems reminiscent of a face.  A section of river freezing into the shape of a bridge. \\
      3          & \textit{Wane Earth} spells shatter ice, but leave behind impressions of people or beasts which the caster knows well. \\
      4          & Summoned mist looks like the caster's face (or how they think of their own face). \\
      5          & \textit{Warp Fate} spells breed encounters that resemble pivotal moments of the caster's life.  \textit{Wax Death} spread pustules across a target in the shape of a map where the caster lives.  \\
      6          & Every spell looks like the caster, or an intimate face. \\
\end{boxtable}

As the spells gain more detail, they become restricted to the caster's most vivid memories, and eventually cannot represent anything but people or places they love or hate.%
\footnote{Spellcasters who end a close relationship abruptly often haunt themselves for decades through their own spells.}
This restricts the possible forms of the spell to people and places the caster knows intimately, and provides a strong clue about the caster's identity, making it difficult to cast spells secretly.

A couple of \glspl{mp} spent on a \textit{Detailed Witness} allow a witch to ascertain if an \textit{oak} fire burns inside a building, or if a casket contains wine.
As before, all questions will only receive a `yes/ no' answer.

\paragraph{Distant}
magics can strike across any amount of space, reaching the anterior side of a town, over mountains, or even past the range of any eye.
Even the caster cannot limit or contain these spells; a \textit{Detailed,  Distant, Wax Air} spell begins at `shouting distance'.
Not `up to a maximum of ``shouting distance'', if you please', but at that minimum and maximum.
Spells all have some leeway in their range (as the vague descriptor of distance ought to imply), but they cannot be expanded and later limited.

\begin{boxtable}[cLL]
  \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Standard Distance} & \textbf{Enhanced Distance}        \\
  \hline
    \setcounter{spellCost}{1}
    \arabic{spellCost}
      & \setRange\spellRange & ---                  \\
    \stepcounter{spellCost}
    \arabic{spellCost}
      & \setRange\spellRange & \toggletrue{distant}\setRange\spellRange \\
    \stepcounter{spellCost}
    \arabic{spellCost}
      & \setRange\spellRange & \toggletrue{distant}\setRange\spellRange \\
    \stepcounter{spellCost}
    \arabic{spellCost}
      & \setRange\spellRange & \toggletrue{distant}\setRange\spellRange \\
    \stepcounter{spellCost}
    \arabic{spellCost}
      & \setRange\spellRange & \toggletrue{distant}\setRange\spellRange \\
    \stepcounter{spellCost}
    \arabic{spellCost}
      & ---                  & \toggletrue{distant}\setRange\spellRange \\
\end{boxtable}

Of course, casters must clearly perceive something in order to cast upon it, so anything outside of clear vision demands a \textit{Distant Witness} precursor.
Once casters can \textit{Witness} someone, they can cast upon them, for the short moment when while the awareness lasts.
Of course, guessing where rivers and houses in the distance might be does not have a high success rate, so setting up these \textit{Distant} spells requires patience, planning, and a way to keep precise records about trajectories.

These \textit{Distant Witness} deductions and maps can take weeks or years of planning for targets far beyond sight.

\begin{exampletext}
  The ability to gain knowledge from a distance allows \glspl{doula} and elves to produce excellent maps.
  Combining this \textit{Descriptor} with \textit{Distant} and \textit{Duplicated}, allows them to inquire about a large area, and then narrow down the space they want to know about.
  Of course, this process requires a lot of skill -- simply locating \pgls{village} from a distance might require listening for something \textit{Detailed} (for the rock), \textit{Distant}, and \textit{Duplicated}.
  One might then discover the location of a particular person by seeking out the sapphire pendant they wear, using \textit{Detailed Witness Earth}.

  These spells also make long-ranged warfare possible, as casters can send storms, bad luck, or poisoned water after each other.
  Two witches having a duel to the death looks less like a spark-filled inferno of spell-slinging, and more like a protracted game of battleship, with plenty of involvement for bystanders any time one guesses wrong.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{figure*}[t!]
  \centering
  \speltogram
  \label{speltogram}
  \index{Elements}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Divergent}
channel mana through opposing spheres to create two parallel, but divergent, spells at the same time.
Check the Speltogram \vpageref{speltogram}, and notice that each Sphere has two neighbouring Spheres, and two opposing Spheres.
Divergent spells construct a single spell-sentence to be used by two opposing Spheres at the same time.

For example, Water sits between its neighbours Earth and Fate, but opposes Air and Fire.
So a caster with Water 2 and Air 2 could create a \textit{Divergent, Wax Water \& Air} spell, which would make surrounding waters jump and thrash, along with gusts of wind.

These two spells will affect different substances, and the caster can direct them at different targets.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  A \textit{Divergent Wane Fire, Fate} spell would make a torch dim to nothing, while the torch-bearer target loses \glspl{fp}.
  \item
  Encountering some bandits, \pgls{doula} uses a \textit{Duplicated, Divergent, Warp Fire \& Fate} spell.
  Their campfire burns green, and their luck shifts -- the possible forest encounters swing strongly in favour of basilisks.
  \item
  Using \textit{Divergent Witness Water \& Air}, \pgls{pc} could find out if a cavern of air or water existed beneath them (although they would not know which -- only that `yes, one of them exists').
  \item
  While a \textit{Divergent, Duplicated, Wane Mind \& Light} spell would create a large patch of darkness, and plunge anyone inside into confusion.
\end{itemize}

As usual, casters make a single roll to resolve the spell, and apply the result to everything.
A \textit{Divergent, Distant, Wane Earth \& Fate} spell may require a roll of \tn[7] to give someone bad luck, and \tn[14] to make the rock-face above them crumble.
If the caster rolls a total of 13, they would inflict the bad luck, but not make the rock-face crumble.

\paragraph{Duplicated}
\label{magic:duplicated}
spells fork like lightning, affecting every available target nearby.
The caster selects only where the spell begins, nothing more.

\sidebox{
  \begin{boxtable}[cX]
    \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Targets}%
    \footnote{Each number is simply $n^n$, so at level 3, a spell has $3^3$ targets, or $3\times 3\times 3$.}\\
    \hline
           1       & 1     \\
           2       & 4     \\
           3       & 27    \\
           4       & 256   \\
           5       & 3125  \\
           6       & 46656 \\
  \end{boxtable}
}

\textit{Duplicated} spells seep through contiguous targets until they spend their energy on enough mass, so a \textit{Duplicated Wax Water} spell which reaches a river will affect a large section of that river, but will never affect a nearby barrel or tankard.
Conversely, Fate spells can only target people (outside of rare and strange situations).
So any Fate spell duplicated to four copies would affect the first target, and the nearest three.

Each copy of the spell can jump the same range as the original spell's range, so they can spread far.
This can present problems; if a caster makes three enemy torches explode in their faces, but the spell requires four targets, then the spell may return to unleash itself on a torch held by the caster's own troupe.

Spells which cannot find an appropriate target within range just fizzle and die, without effect.

\begin{exampletext}
  The incredible range and power of high-level spells holds deep implications for \gls{fenestra}.
  Any attempt at wide-scale wars runs the risk of a skilled caster targeting one, or both, armies with a crippling spell.
  This simple fact poses a dire risk to anyone attempting to start a war.

  However, someone who can fight on, despite blinding fog, a snowstorm, or their torches and camp-fire suddenly going out, will not be more troubled by a spell simply because it affects a thousand more people.
  As a result, a few specialist trackers, or veteran \glspl{guard}, can often fare better against powerful spell-casters than an army of field-workers with swords.
\end{exampletext}

\subsubsection{Resolution \& Effects}

The spells described so far may sound very open-ended, or even badly-defined, and they are!
However, the results are not.
The five elemental Spheres have a numerical, mechanical result equal to the number of \glspl{mp} spent~+2.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  A \textit{Wax Earth} spell which solidifies snow over a door, and stops anyone entering, costs 1~\gls{mp}, so it inflicts a -3 penalty to break down the door.
  \item
  A \textit{Duplicated Wane Air} spell which blinds archers with mist requires 2~\glspl{mp}, so it inflicts a -4 penalty to using arrows at any kind of range.
  \item
  A \textit{Divergent, Detailed Wax Fate, \& Fire} spell could bless the caster's ally with a +1 Bonus to using the Combat Skill over their next 5 actions, and make an enemy's torch transform into a monstrous face which attempts to eat them.
  The burning torch inflicts 5~Damage, which translates to \dmg{5}~Damage.%
  \exRef{core}{Core Rules}{stackingDamage}
\end{itemize}

The final part of the spell is the resistance -- the \gls{gm} stipulates some standard force which stands in the way of the spell.
Sometimes spells have obvious forces acting against them (such as the strength of a rock, when one wants it to crumble), while other spells have less obvious barriers (good luck spells often have trouble taking effect when the recipients are not paying attention).

\subsection{Principles of Magic}

Once you read enough spells, they should start to feel repetitive.
The steps above were used to create each one, so once the spells in the Core Rules start to feel familiar, making spells on-the-fly should become quickly intuitive.

On top of those steps, keep the general principles below in mind when crafting new spells.

\subsubsection{Plan or Die}

Sooner or later someone will fail to see a spell's natural consequences.
Someone may cast a spell to make their enemies shrink and become weak, then notice the spell's range is `to the horizon', which means the spell cannot actually target those enemies.
Or perhaps a spell intended to kill all seven bandits has twenty-four targets, and therefore targets the bandits, all of the \glspl{pc}, every ally, and the \gls{doula}'s pet magpie.
The system intends for players and the \gls{gm} to make these mistakes.

Magic creates unintended side-effects, but they don't fall out of random rolls and a `random magic effect' table.
They come from the \ref{sphereEffects} principles above.

\subsubsection{Potent, Yet Barren}

Magic cannot create.
It warps, waxes, and wanes.
It gives information.
But nothing in the world comes from nothing, so spellcasters make the world pulse, or transform, but cannot remove or add the sum of all that is the case.
Witches may control fire, but only a fire striker can \textit{make} it.

\subsubsection{Spells Last Until Death}

Spells have no set `duration'.
Fires burn until their fuel runs out.
The undead burn through the spell which animates them every time they move.
Life spells which bolster a target's Bonuses often demand the target burn through calories in order to keep the spell going, and then fade to nothing once the spell ends.

The first principle here is that if something seems like it could stop the effects of a spell, it stops the spell.
The second principle is that spells can last forever, but they do not \emph{produce} anything forever.

\subsubsection{Spells Stack as Usual}

Stacking spell effects should work exactly like any other Stacking.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{stacking}
Casting two Life spells, which both inflict a -2 Penalty to someone's Speed results in a -2~Penalty, because these spells do the same thing.
However, two different Spheres which create a Speed Penalty would Stack as usual.

So spell Stacking works exactly like armour -- wearing chainmail on top of plate will not work well, but a character could gain \gls{dr} through a touch hide, and then add armour to gain half the \gls{dr} for the lower of the two protection-types.

\end{multicols}

\section{\Glsfmttext{ingredient} Workshop}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
`\Glspl{ingredient}' means anything which can help with arcane practices, and each \gls{ingredient} aligns to one of the Low Spheres.
Most \glspl{ingredient} come from the bodies of beasts, such as a basilisk's gullet, or griffin feathers.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmttext{boon} Creation}

Casters can add a little extra power to their spells by taking raw \glspl{ingredient}, and crafting them into \glspl{boon}.
\Glspl{boon} come in the form of powders or liquids, to be thrown in the air at the point of casting, and add +1 to any Sphere.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \Glspl{boon} demand at least 1 \gls{ap} to use from the caster's hand, as usual.
  \item
  \Glspl{boon} remain suffused in the air until someone (anyone) consumes the energy by casting a spell.
  \item
  \Glspl{boon} can increase multiple Spheres by combining multiple \glspl{ingredient}, but only by 1 level each.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
With the help of a Fire \gls{boon}, someone without any magical ability could cast a level 1 Fire spell, or a caster with Fire 2, Earth 3 could cast a level 3 Force spell.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmttext{talisman} Creation}

With the right \glspl{ingredient}, one can create \pgls{talisman}, which stores a spell, and releases it once the conditions have been met.

\Glspl{talisman} require \glspl{ingredient}, rather than magical Spheres to cast.
Anyone can make one, with the right knowledge, and the ability to coax a little life into the material world with the right words.

By default, \pgls{talisman} will target the nearest thing it can.
However, many casters add a \textit{Witness} activity to the \gls{talisman}, to let it target something else.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  The creator starts by arranging their \glspl{ingredient} -- these will give effective access to spell Spheres.
  Casting with Fire 2, Earth 2 would require 2 Earth \glspl{ingredient} and 2 Fire \glspl{ingredient}.
  \item
  Crafters must make \glspl{talisman} from materials aligned to the Spheres in use.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Air]
    uses contained gasses, often held in a phial.
    \item[Earth]
    requires any solid materials dug from the ground.
    \item[Fate]
    talismans require the remains of someone who had \glspl{fp} in life (at least 1 per \gls{ingredient} used in the spell).
    \item[Fire]
    requires flammable material.
    \item[Water]
    can use any liquid.
  \end{description}
  \item
  Next, the \gls{talisman} needs a spell to cast, once it detects something.
  Fire spells will, by default, target the nearest fire they can; Air spells will almost certainly target surrounding air.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The \gls{talisman} casts its spell with a bonus equal to the spell's level, so a level 3 Air spell with a cost of 3 \glspl{mp}, made into \pgls{talisman}, casts its spell with a +3 bonus, rather than the normal roll of \roll{Charisma}{Air}.
    \item
    The creator may include a \textit{Witness} action which the \gls{talisman} will use to detect the target.
    It will then target the nearest thing the \textit{Witnessing} finds.
    \item
    This ability to \textit{Witness} requires further \glspl{ingredient}, but it does not require another roll to construct.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  The creator then decides upon the talisman's activation conditions -- will it activate once it sees starlight?
  Or awaken to any loud noises?
  Or activate when someone solves a riddle, engraved on its surface?
  \item
  The alchemical process requires an \roll{Charisma}{Academics} check, \tn[10] plus double the spell's cost.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\begin{exampletext}
Courtblight wants to make \pgls{talisman} to help her companions flee when they're in trouble.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  She can't cast Force spells herself, but she has two Earth \glspl{ingredient} and two Fire \glspl{ingredient}, so that can make \pgls{talisman} with a level 2 \textit{Wax Duplicate Force} spell.
  \item
  She takes the \glspl{ingredient} (two woodspy eyes, and a lot of basilisk hide) and boils both for several days, reducing them to an inky paste.
  \item
  She takes her materials (paper for the Fire, crushed amethyst for Earth) and works the dust into the paper, then writes across it with the inky paste from her pot.
  \item
  Finally, she whispers the activation words, `let me fly', into the scroll, over and over, with some doodles of griffins around the margins.

  With this, the player rolls \roll{Charisma}{Academics} at \tn[14].
\end{itemize}

Once done, she casts a spell to detect the mana locked in the scroll, and finds nothing\ldots the ritual awoke nothing, the item will remain fruitless, and the \glspl{ingredient} wasted.

She decides that next time, she will ask for help creating the item.
