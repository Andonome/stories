# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from words, and eventually forms a sentence.

A magical sphere is a *Noun* of some kind, like 'Air', 'Fire', 'Desire', or 'Fate'.
Mages with those spheres can alter these targets, by giving them one of the following verbs:

- Alter
- Detect
- Create
- Destroy

...and then adding an adjective.

- Wide (making the target big)
- Ranged (giving the spell more range)
- Complex (making aesthetic changes)
- Sentient

*Example: The caster wants to make someone's torch burn into an explosion, covering everyone around. He selects **Alter, Wide, Fire**, costing 2 MP. He rolls Charisma + Crafts, at TN 9 (that's 7 + 1 per MP spent).*

## Spheres

Each magic sphere is really a Noun.

- Fire
- Air
- Plant
- Water
- Flesh
- Nether
- Fate
- Desire
- Space

## Verbs

### Create

(maybe 'manifest' instead of 'create'?)

Unsure how to cost size.

- Mages should be able to create monsters (*Make Sentient Flesh*)
- But we can't have them making giant monsters easily.

---

*Perhaps some costing table like this would work.*

| Cost | Size                                |
|:----:|:------------------------------------|
|  2   | Weightless (fire, air)              |
|  3   | Small (swarm creatures)             |
|  4   | Humanoid (strength equals ???)      |
|  5+  | Each MP adds +1 Strength            |

*Or perhaps there is an easier way to achieve this, without a table to look up - a single, simple, rule.*

### Alter

To alter another creature should raise the TN by the creature's HP.

*Perhaps this should be just 'current HP', so creatures can be beaten down, then turned to stone?'

## Modifiers

Each modifier is an adjective.

- Ranged
- Wide
- Sentient
- Complex

0. 5 steps
1. 10 steps

2. Basic self-awareness: the spell has -5 Intelligence and Charisma.
3. Real intelligence: the spell has Intelligence and Charisma 0.
4. Self-preservation: the spell will attempt to not go out.

### Complex

0. Bland and normal
1. Small aesthetic changes ('kinda looks like a face')

# Principles

- Damage: ???
- Penalties: 1/ Mana
- Attribute Bonuses: 1 Mana = +1 Attribute
- Creating solid bodies requires mana to be spent on each.
- Created Attributes are set half the Mana Spent.
- Created things require 1 MP per Weight rating.



# Nouns

## Nethermancy

Nethermancy should adjust the link between souls and bodies.
Placing strange, demonic, souls into a body will raise the undead.


---
*Perhaps the souls could each come from a different after-life, controlled by a different god?*

Afterlife types:
    - Ohta: Combat
    - Cale: Seekers, 
    - Alasse: Hungry, 
    - Qualme: Servants?
    - Vere: Anti-Paladin, diligent,
