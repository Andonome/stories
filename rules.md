# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from 3 actions and 4 optional enhancements.

Mages become skilled in low-level spheres, such as Fire, Fate, or Air, then combine them to work with high-level spheres, such as Light, Death, and Force.

### Summary

- The caster can spend a number of MP equal to the highest sphere they want to use.
- MP spent on enhancements increase the potency of every enhancement.

## Spheres

Mages can only target their spheres directly, but can use these spheres to target others.

### Low Spheres

- Fire
- Air
- Earth
- Water
- Fate

### High Spheres

By combining two low spheres, you can create a high sphere:

- Mind (Fate + Water)
- Life (Earth + Water)
- Force (Earth + Fire)
- Light (Fire + Air)
- Death (Air + Fate)

## Enhancements

Enhancements change the target in different ways.
Each spell needs at least one enhancement.

Enhancements also increase a spell's *Potency*.
When you add another enhancement, each enhancement grows.

- Detailed
- Duplicated
- Divergent
- Distant
    - (standard) 6 + MP steps
    2. Throwing distance
    3. Shouting distance
    4. Horizon
    5. Line of sight

## Complications

### Small Targets

These problems for spellcasters raise the difficulty:

- Tiny target (+2)

The TN for spells is 6 + challenges + MP spent.

Casters can spend a number of MP equal to the highest sphere they are using.
They can power high spheres with any combination of mana.

## Mind

1. Does one simple thing. (Wits -4)
    * "Kill jester"
    * "Defend against this dragon"
    * Does not understand categories (like 'bandits', or 'goblins').
2. Does two-part missions (but no 'if-then' statements, or anything equivalent, has Wits -2)
    * "Find John and whisper this message to him."
    * "Approach the king, then explode."
    * "Enter the village, then report back."
    * Can distinguish people at a glance.
3. Does any complex tasks asked of it. (Intelligence -2, Wits -2, Charisma -2 and 5 points to spend among Mental Attributes)
    * Has the same Code as the caster (if none is specified).
    * Will attempt to suicide if it gets bored.
    * Tends to become obsessed with its first mission ("Ah, the good old days, when I was protecting against goblins. I should go find more goblins...")
    * Can make subtle distinctions.
    * "Kill any elves who look like they're spying for King Alreth"
    * Debates the definitions of tasks with the caster ("When you say 'men', do you mean all humans? Or all males? Or human males? And do you mean specifically adults?").
    * Refuses to stop its mission ("everyone's not dead till I say they're dead. You for example are not dead")
    * Makes long-term plans.
    * Knows all the basic concepts the mage knows (people, places, et c.)
    * Wants to be treated as an equal.
    * Has 1 sphere of magic.
4. Does any tasks asked of it...initially (Intelligence -2, Wits -2, Charisma -2 and 6 points to spend among Mental Attributes)
    * Has 2 levels of magic spheres.
    * Knows half the mind of the mage.
    * "Bow, mortal, before the god of crafting abodes."
    * "Your architectural plans are shoddy, and weak, because they use wood."
    * "I have devised a new type of home, built entirely from the metal of the swords of my enemies."
    * "Procure the following list for me, or I shall begin selling your secrets to king Alreth to procure them myself."
