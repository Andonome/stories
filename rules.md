# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from 3 actions and 4 optional enhancements.

Mages become skilled in low-level spheres, such as Fire, Fate, or Air, then combine them to work with high-level spheres, such as Light, Death, and Force.

### Summary

- The caster can spend a number of MP equal to the highest sphere they want to use.
- MP spent on enhancements increase the potency of every enhancement.

## Spheres

Mages can only target their spheres directly, but can use these spheres to target others.

### Low Spheres

- Fire
- Air
- Earth
- Water
- Fate

### High Spheres

By combining two low spheres, you can create a high sphere:

- Mind (Fate + Water)
- Life (Earth + Water)
- Force (Earth + Fire)
- Light (Fire + Air)
- Death (Air + Fate)

## Enhancements

Enhancements change the target in different ways.
Each spell needs at least one enhancement.

Enhancements also increase a spell's *Potency*.
When you add another enhancement, each enhancement grows.

- Detailed
- Duplicated
- Divergent
- Distant
    - (standard) 6 + MP steps
    2. Throwing distance
    3. Shouting distance
    4. Horizon
    5. Line of sight

## Complications

### Small Targets

These problems for spellcasters raise the difficulty:

- Tiny target (+2)

The TN for spells is 6 + challenges + MP spent.

Casters can spend a number of MP equal to the highest sphere they are using.
They can power high spheres with any combination of mana.
