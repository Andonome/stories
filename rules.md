# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from words, and eventually forms a sentence.

A magical sphere is a *Noun* of some kind, like 'Air', 'Fire', 'Desire', or 'Fate'.
Mages with those spheres can alter these targets, and enhance spells with a number of modifiers, like 'wide' or 'subtle'.

## Verbs

- Detect
- Alter

*Example: The caster wants to make someone's torch burn into an explosion, covering everyone around. He selects **Alter, Wide, Fire**, costing 2 MP. He rolls Charisma + Crafts, at TN 9 (that's 7 + 1 per MP spent).*

## Spheres

Each magic sphere is really a Noun.

### Low Spheres

- Fire
- Air
- Earth
- Water
- Fate

### High Spheres

By combining two low spheres, you can create a high sphere:

- Mind
- Life
- Force
- Illusion
- Death

## Enhancements

- Wide (making the target big)
    * But if you cast too wide, the spell might hit unintended targets.
- Ranged (giving the spell more range)
    * But if you cast too far away, the spell misses.
- Colourful (making aesthetic changes)
    * No penalties for massive spells - they just get more detailed.
- Conjured
    * Large spells don't have a penalty...*but*
    * The amount of 'created' water will be smaller then the amount of water you can alter.
- Enduring? (spell lasts for a long time)
    * Unsure what to do with 'enduring fire'.
    * If you make a spell too enduring then the consequences depend on the spell, but *some spells* probably won't be good.
- Subtle (so nobody knows you're casting a spell)
    * This doesn't really fit the pattern.
    * It doesn't get stronger with more mana.
    * It doesn't provide some penalty when it's 'too big'.

Maybe 'Subtle' needs to be cut?
