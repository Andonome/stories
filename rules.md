# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from words, and eventually forms a sentence.

A magical sphere is a *Noun* of some kind, like 'Air', 'Fire', 'Desire', or 'Fate'.
Mages with those spheres can alter these targets, and enhance spells with a number of modifiers, like 'wide' or 'subtle'.

## Spheres

Each magic sphere is really a Noun.

### Low Spheres

- Fire
- Air
- Earth
- Water
- Fate

### High Spheres

By combining two low spheres, you can create a high sphere:

- Mind (Fate + Water)
- Life (Earth + Water)
- Force (Earth + Fire)
- Illusion (Fire + Air)
- Death (Air + Fate)

## Enhancements

- Wide (making the target big)
    * But if you cast too wide, the spell might hit unintended targets.
- Ranged (giving the spell more range)
    * But if you cast too far away, the spell misses.
- Colourful (making aesthetic changes)
    * No penalties for massive spells - they just get more detailed.
- Conjured
    * Large spells don't have a penalty...*but*
    * The amount of 'created' water will be smaller then the amount of water you can alter.
- Enduring? (spell lasts for a long time)
    * Unsure what to do with 'enduring fire'.
    * If you make a spell too enduring then the consequences depend on the spell, but *some spells* probably won't be good.

# Casting Rules

The TN for spells is 6 + MP spent.

Casters can spend a number of MP equal to the highest sphere they are using.
They can power high spheres with any combination of mana.

## Tiny Targets

Targeting a bow's string, or a sword's mostly-hidden handle makes a spell difficult, and adds +1 to the TN.


# Principles

### Range

Standard spells have a range of 4 Steps plus double the spell's MP.
*Ranged* spells increase this significantly.

The caster can only limit the range *inside* the bounds of their current range.
A *ranged fire* spell, cast with 3 MP, can target anywhere inside 'throwing distance', but cannot target anyone 10 Steps away.
A ranged spell with 6 MP cannot target anywhere around the mage, or anywhere they can see - it only targets distant areas visible only with spells.

2. 10 Steps.
3. Throwing distance.
4. Shouting distance.
5. Line of sight.
6. Anywhere the caster can detect with any sense, including magic.
7. Anywhere the caster has once been.

Spells which travel 'too far' usually fail, but sometimes find their own location to explode.

### General Penalties

Penalties to common things, like running or attacking convert 1 MP to a -1 penalty.

### Specialized Penalties

Specialized penalties, such as spells which inhibit aiming, speaking, or lying, inflict a -2 penalty per MP spent.

### Swarms

Swarms occur when someone casts a 'conjure wide life' spell.

The creature's Speed and Dexterity are both -2.
The 'colourful' and 'enduring' enhancements each add +1 Dexterity.
The 'ranged' enhancement adds +2 Speed.

3. 3 creatures with -4 Strength each.
4. 6 creatures with -3 Strength each.
5. 12 creatures with -2 Strength each.
6. 24 creatures with -1 Strength each.
7. 48 creatures with +0 Strength each.

### Conjured Life

'Heavy things' include creating animals, rock, or ice.
'Heavy things' cannot be made 'wide', or they will split apart (see 'swarms' above).

2. Weight 4, -2 Strength.
3. Weight 6, +0 Strength.
4. Weight 8, +2 Strength.
5. Weight 10, +4 Strength.
6. Weight 12, +6 Strength.

### Alter Life

### Area of Effect

This works with 'wide' spells to alter things with limited or no weight.

Regular spells target any person-sized item.

2. Big table, or four people standing together.
3. Entire room, or copse of trees.
4. Copse of trees, hamlet, stream.
5. A village, stretch of river, inlet, or hill.
6. A city, entire river, mineshaft, or catacomb.
7. Entire mountain, a valley, or loch.

### Flame Strength

- Candle: 1 Damage
- Torch: 2 Damage
- Cooking fire: 3 Damage
- Bonfire: 4 Damage
- Smelting fire: 5 Damage

### Create Mind

When casters 'create mind', the amount of sentience depends on the total mana spent.

- Colourful: give a particular personality, or 'Code' to the imbued mind.
- Wide: Many things (of the same type) become sentient.

    * "Kill jester"
    * "Defend against the dragon"
    * Cannot identify anyone except 'creator', 'moving things', 'not moving things'
3. Does two-part missions (but no 'if-then' statements, or anything equivalent, has Wits -2)
    * "Find John and whisper this message to him."
    * "Approach the king, then explode."

5. Does any complex tasks asked of it. (Intelligence -2, Wits -2, Charisma -2 and 5 points to spend among Mental Attributes)
    * Has the same Code as the caster (if none is specified).
    * Can make subtle distinctions.
    * "Kill any elves who look like they're spying for King Alreth"
    * Debates the definitions of tasks with the caster ("When you say 'men', do you mean all humans? Or all males? Or human males? And do you mean specifically adults?").
    * Refuses to stop its mission ("everyone's not dead till I say they're dead. You for example are not dead")
    * Makes long-term plans.
    * Knows all the basic concepts the mage knows (people, places, et c.)
