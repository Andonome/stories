# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from words, and eventually forms a sentence.

A magical sphere is a *Noun* of some kind, like 'Air', 'Fire', 'Desire', or 'Fate'.
Mages with those spheres can alter these targets, and enhance spells with a number of modifiers, like 'wide' or 'subtle'.

## Verbs

- Detect
- Alter

*Example: The caster wants to make someone's torch burn into an explosion, covering everyone around. He selects **Alter, Wide, Fire**, costing 2 MP. He rolls Charisma + Crafts, at TN 9 (that's 7 + 1 per MP spent).*

## Spheres

Each magic sphere is really a Noun.

### Low Spheres

- Fire
- Air
- Earth
- Water
- Fate

### High Spheres

By combining two low spheres, you can create a high sphere:

- Mind (Fate + Water)
- Life (Earth + Water)
- Force (Earth + Fire)
- Illusion (Fire + Air)
- Death (Air + Fate)

## Enhancements

- Wide (making the target big)
    * But if you cast too wide, the spell might hit unintended targets.
- Ranged (giving the spell more range)
    * But if you cast too far away, the spell misses.
- Colourful (making aesthetic changes)
    * No penalties for massive spells - they just get more detailed.
- Conjured
    * Large spells don't have a penalty...*but*
    * The amount of 'created' water will be smaller then the amount of water you can alter.
- Enduring? (spell lasts for a long time)
    * Unsure what to do with 'enduring fire'.
    * If you make a spell too enduring then the consequences depend on the spell, but *some spells* probably won't be good.
- Subtle (so nobody knows you're casting a spell)
    * This doesn't really fit the pattern.
    * It doesn't get stronger with more mana.
    * It doesn't provide some penalty when it's 'too big'.

Maybe 'Subtle' needs to be cut?

## Principles

### Range

Standard spells have a range of 4 Steps plus double the spell's MP.
*Ranged* spells increase this significantly.

The caster can only limit the range *inside* the bounds of their current range.
A *ranged fire* spell, cast with 3 MP, can target anywhere inside 'throwing distance', but cannot target anyone 10 Steps away.
A ranged spell with 6 MP cannot target anywhere around the mage, or anywhere they can see - it only targets distant areas visible only with spells.

2. 10 Steps.
3. Throwing distance.
4. Shouting distance.
5. Line of sight.
6. Anywhere the caster can detect with any sense, including magic.
7. Anywhere the caster has once been.

Spells which travel 'too far' usually fail, but sometimes find their own location to explode.

### Detect

Detect spells with more MP provide more information.
The basic spell provides a 'yes/ no' answer.
If the answer is 'it's complicated' then the GM flips a coin.

2. Spell can say 'it's complicated'. The mage only knows the target lives somewhere in the area, not exactly where the target lies.
3. The mage can ask one question about the properties of the target.
    * "Does this fire have metal in it?"
    * "Are any of the trees sick?"
4. The mage learns any unusual properties of the target if they are present; and if they are far, they can pinpoint the cardinal direction of the target.
    * "This creature's beak is unusually strong"
    * "This mind is thinking about murder more than is healthy or normal."
    * The target lies roughly East.
5. The mage knows the exact direction of the target, if searching for them. If they already see the target, they can ask about the target's history.
    * The mage knows the exact direction of the target.
    * "This water came from Mt Arthur, where goblins have set up camp."
6. ???

#### Colourful Detect

A 'colourful' Detect spell operates as an 'alteration' spell at the same time, where the alteration spell forces the target to give up information.

### Swarms

Swarms occur when someone casts a 'conjure wide life' spell.

The creature's Speed and Dexterity are both -2.
The 'colourful' and 'enduring' enhancements each add +1 Dexterity.
The 'ranged' enhancement adds +2 Speed.

3. 3 creatures with -4 Strength each.
4. 6 creatures with -3 Strength each.
5. 12 creatures with -2 Strength each.
6. 24 creatures with -1 Strength each.
7. 48 creatures with +0 Strength each.

### Conjured Life

'Heavy things' include creating animals, rock, or ice.
'Heavy things' cannot be made 'wide', or they will split apart (see 'swarms' above).

2. Weight 4, -2 Strength.
3. Weight 6, +0 Strength.
4. Weight 8, +2 Strength.
5. Weight 10, +4 Strength.
6. Weight 12, +6 Strength.

### Alter Life

### Area of Effect

This works with 'wide' spells to alter or detect things with limited or no weight.

Regular spells target any person-sized item.

2. Big table, or four people standing together.
3. Entire room, or copse of trees.
4. Copse of trees, hamlet, stream.
5. A village, stretch of river, inlet, or hill.
6. A city, entire river, mineshaft, or catacomb.
7. Entire mountain, a valley, or loch.

### Flame Strength

- Candle: 1 Damage
- Torch: 2 Damage
- Cooking fire: 3 Damage
- Bonfire: 4 Damage
- Smelting fire: 5 Damage

### Create Mind

When casters 'create mind', the amount of sentience depends on the total mana spent.

- Colourful: give a particular personality, or 'Code' to the imbued mind.
- Wide: Many things (of the same type) become sentient.

    * "Kill jester"
    * "Defend against the dragon"
    * Cannot identify anyone except 'creator', 'moving things', 'not moving things'
3. Does two-part missions (but no 'if-then' statements, or anything equivalent, has Wits -2)
    * "Find John and whisper this message to him."
    * "Approach the king, then explode."
    * "Enter the village, then report back."
    * Can distinguish people at a glance.

    * Makes long-term plans.
