# Underlying Logic

This magic system builds spells from words, and eventually forms a sentence.

A magical sphere is a *Noun* of some kind, like 'Air', 'Fire', 'Desire', or 'Fate'.
Mages with those spheres can alter these targets, and enhance spells with a number of modifiers, like 'wide' or 'subtle'.

## Verbs

- Detect
- Alter

*Example: The caster wants to make someone's torch burn into an explosion, covering everyone around. He selects **Alter, Wide, Fire**, costing 2 MP. He rolls Charisma + Crafts, at TN 9 (that's 7 + 1 per MP spent).*

## Spheres

Each magic sphere is really a Noun.

### Low Spheres

- Fire
- Air
- Earth
- Water
- Fate

### High Spheres

By combining two low spheres, you can create a high sphere:

- Mind (Fate + Water)
- Life (Earth + Water)
- Force (Earth + Fire)
- Illusion (Fire + Air)
- Death (Air + Fate)

## Enhancements

- Wide (making the target big)
    * But if you cast too wide, the spell might hit unintended targets.
- Ranged (giving the spell more range)
    * But if you cast too far away, the spell misses.
- Colourful (making aesthetic changes)
    * No penalties for massive spells - they just get more detailed.
- Conjured
    * Large spells don't have a penalty...*but*
    * The amount of 'created' water will be smaller then the amount of water you can alter.
- Enduring? (spell lasts for a long time)
    * Unsure what to do with 'enduring fire'.
    * If you make a spell too enduring then the consequences depend on the spell, but *some spells* probably won't be good.
- Subtle (so nobody knows you're casting a spell)
    * This doesn't really fit the pattern.
    * It doesn't get stronger with more mana.
    * It doesn't provide some penalty when it's 'too big'.

Maybe 'Subtle' needs to be cut?

## Principles

### Swarms

Swarms occur when someone casts a 'conjure wide life' spell.

The creature's Speed and Dexterity are both -2.
The 'colourful' and 'enduring' enhancements each add +1 Dexterity.
The 'ranged' enhancement adds +2 Speed.

3. 3 creatures with -4 Strength each.
4. 6 creatures with -3 Strength each.
5. 12 creatures with -2 Strength each.
6. 24 creatures with -1 Strength each.

### Conjured Life

'Heavy things' include creating animals, rock, or ice.
'Heavy things' cannot be made 'wide', or they will split apart (see 'swarms' above).

2. Weight 4, -2 Strength.
3. Weight 6, +0 Strength.
4. Weight 8, +2 Strength.
5. Weight 10, +4 Strength.
6. Weight 12, +6 Strength.

### Alter Life

### Area of Effect

This works with 'wide' spells to alter or detect things with limited or no weight.

1. Person-sized
2. Big table, or four people standing together.
3. Entire room, or copse of trees.
4. Copse of trees, hamlet, stream.
5. A village, stretch of river, inlet, or hill.
6. A city, entire river, mineshaft, or catacomb.
7. Entire mountain, a valley, or loch.

### Create Mind

When casters 'create mind', the amount of sentience depends on the total mana spent.

- Colourful: give a particular personality, or 'Code' to the imbued mind.
- Wide: Many things (of the same type) become sentient.

2. Does one simple thing. (Wits -4)
    * "Kill jester"
    * "Defend against the dragon"
    * Cannot identify anyone except 'creator', 'moving things', 'not moving things'
3. Does two-part missions (but no 'if-then' statements, or anything equivalent, has Wits -2)
    * "Find John and whisper this message to him."
    * "Approach the king, then explode."
    * "Enter the village, then report back."
    * Can distinguish people at a glance.
4. Does one complex task. (Intelligence -2, Wits -2, Charisma -2 and 4 points to spend among Mental Attributes)
    * Understands if-then statements.
    * Thinks about its own future.
    * Can make real judgements about people's mood or actions.
    * Tends to become obsessed with its first mission ("Ah, the good old days, when I was protecting against goblins. I should go find more goblins...")
    * Will attempt to suicide if it gets bored.
5. Does any complex tasks asked of it. (Intelligence -2, Wits -2, Charisma -2 and 5 points to spend among Mental Attributes)
    * Has the same Code as the caster (if none is specified).
    * Can make subtle distinctions.
    * "Kill any elves who look like they're spying for King Alreth"
    * Debates the definitions of tasks with the caster ("When you say 'men', do you mean all humans? Or all males? Or human males? And do you mean specifically adults?").
    * Refuses to stop its mission ("everyone's not dead till I say they're dead. You for example are not dead")
    * Makes long-term plans.
    * Knows all the basic concepts the mage knows (people, places, et c.)
    * Wants to be treated as an equal.
    * Has 1 sphere of magic.
6. Does any tasks asked of it...initially (Intelligence -2, Wits -2, Charisma -2 and 6 points to spend among Mental Attributes)
    * Has 2 levels of magic spheres.
    * Knows half the mind of the mage.
    * "Bow, mortal, before the god of crafting abodes."
    * "Your architectural plans are shoddy, and weak, because they use wood."
    * "I have devised a new type of home, built entirely from the metal of the swords of my enemies."
    * "Procure the following list for me, or I shall begin selling your secrets to king Alreth to procure them myself."
