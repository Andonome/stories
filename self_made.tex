\label{playerchosen}

If players prefer, they can design their own characters by simply setting all Attributes to 0, then applying the racial modifiers.
They can choose to take a single -1 penalty to any Attribute of their choice in return for an additional 5 \gls{xp}.

\subsection{Decisions}
\label{CCDecisions}

To forge your own path into the guard, wander through the rest of the book, stopping at the following places.

\subsection{\nameref{gods_codes} \& Background}

Select a Code of belief from \autoref{gods_codes}, then write down where your character comes from.
  Ask your \gls{gm} which areas and background cultures exist in that world.

\subsection{\Glsentrylongpl{xp}}

Over in \autoref{coreRules}: \nameref{coreRules}, \nameref{xp}, you can spend \glspl{xp} to build up your character's other Traits, such as Skills.
Then select some items from \autoref{goods}.


\subsection{Starting Equipment}
\label{start_equipment}

\label{adventuringequipment}
\index{Adventuring Equipment}

Characters each start with one items per Skill level, and each item can be worth 10 \glspl{sp} or less.
This might include a sword, dagger, a donkey, or anything else worth 10 \gls{sp} or less.
Have a look at the goods available in \autoref{coreRules}: \nameref{coreRules}, \autoref{goods}.
If your character has Combat 1, and Caving 2, they can select 3 items.

The player can decide to replace any of these items with a generic item called \gls{adventure} equipment, and decide exactly what it is later in the game.
\Gls{adventure} equipment cannot be given away or acted upon in any way without stipulating exactly what it is.

\Gls{adventure} equipment can include any of the following items:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}

\item{Chalk}
\item{Flour}
\item{Lock picking set}
\item{Medical equipment}
\item{Mirror}
\item{Rations for a day}
\index{Food}\index{Rations}
\item{Rope}
\item{Tinder box}
\item{Torch}
\item{Wine}
\item{Writing equipment}

\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsubsection{Starting Money}

The amount of bare money a character starts out with depends upon their Skills.
Starting money is $3D6-5$ \glspl{cp}, which doubles for every level the characters has in a Skill.

For example, a character with Empathy 1 and Tactics 1 might roll a total of 7.
$7\times2\times2 = 28$, so the character starts out with 28 \glspl{cp}.

\index{Character Concept}
\subsection{Concept}


Who is this you have brought to the \gls{guard}?

Have a look at your character's Attributes and consider what kind of person they are.
Strength might indicate working on a farm.
A good Charisma may indicate a creative past, such as poetry, or working with the public, trading or selling items.
Intelligent characters may have required to plan a lot -- perhaps working as a seneschal for a town master, or planning a safe route for a travelling circus.
Low intelligence means never having to think, so they may come from a noble family, or always worked in a stonemason's guild, where someone else could plan their day for them.
Dexterous characters could have been an expert weaver, before joining the \gls{guard}; or perhaps they lived in a major city and stole money from others.

How did you end up in the \gls{guard}?
Did you naively sign up for a thrilling adventure, and now regret it?
What happened to your farm?
Torched by goblins, or did too many men leave the village?
Most join simply because they did not inherit their parents' land, so they hope to make some money, and perhaps be rewarded with land.
Some stole or robbed from people, and managed to plead to a judge to let them join the \gls{guard} instead of hanging.

Take your character's history, and condense it into two words.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Betrayed Guildsman
  \item
  Clairvoyant Herder
  \item
  Crypto Zoologist
  \item
  Dispossessed Farmer
  \item
  Dishonoured Alchemist
  \item
  Dauntless Youth

  Failed Priest
