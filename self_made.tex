\label{ngIntroductions}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Introduce your character to the group, and describe what they look like.
The \gls{guard} have no uniform exactly, but they do have a standard `look', due to commonalities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Darkened leather (or a black tabard), hides them in the dark.
  \item
  A special scabbard with a `v-split' along one side, allows the \glspl{guard} to carry a sword on their back, and comfortably draw it.
  \item
  Long hair means they can pull out a strand, to be used as a suture.
  \item
  Large, black, backpack with side-pouches.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Your Rank}
\label{ngRank}
\index{Rank in the \glsentrytext{guard}}
equals the highest rank of the troupe, because life's not fair.
If everyone's new, then everyone begins as `fodder'.

Welcome to the \gls{guard}!

\subsubsection{Requesting Equipment}
is your first task.
You have arrived in \pgls{broch}, ready for your first mission.
It's time to ask the \gls{jotter} if you can have one more piece of equipment from the \nameref{start_equipment}, \vpageref{start_equipment}.
Roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} at \tn[7].

\paragraph{If you succeed,}
think of how your character would do well in a social situation, and describe the result before writing the item on your character sheet.

\paragraph{If you fail,}
describe how your character might fumble the request.
Do they misunderstand the situation, or do they just have a bad attitude?

\paragraph{If you tie,}
think of how your character might fumble, then reverse course.
The jotter gives them the next item on the list, and explains why you should \emph{in fact} use that.

During the game, you can use a dice-roll to indicate that you have something to say.
Just roll, and use the result as a guide to your character's reaction.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{rollForRoles}
Of course, the \gls{gm} may give you a rather different \gls{tn}\ldots

\subsubsection{Mission Equipment}

Most \glspl{broch} hold most of these items, most of the time, but wandering monsters make supply-lines difficult to maintain.

\subsubsection{The Derived Traits}
on your character sheet say what they do, so fill them in.
Remember that you begin with 50~\glspl{xp} `spent' already, which gives you 5~\glspl{fp} + Charisma Bonus.

\section{Forging Allies}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\label{playerchosen}

\noindent
Over \pgls{campaign} you can add a characters to your \gls{characterPool} by spending \pgls{storypoint},
(covered in \autoref{stories})
or spend two \glspl{storypoint} and design your own character.%
\footnote{Covered \vpageref{designCharacter}.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{sumCCrace}
  Select a race, and note your \nameref{racialAbility} (\vpageref{racialAbility}).
  \item\label{sumCCatt}
  Set each of your Attributes to 0, then apply the racial bonuses and penalties (\autopageref{raceRoll}).
  \item\label{sumCCconcept}
  Write down a concept.
  Is this character in the \gls{guard}, or from another temple?
  \item\label{sumCCcode}
  Select a Code to follow, so you can gain \glspl{xp} (\autopageref{codes}).
  \item\label{sumCCxp}
  Spend 50 \gls{xp} on Attributes, Skills, and Knacks (see \autopageref{xpCosts} for the costs).
  \item\label{sumCCequip}
  Take 1 item per Skill level your character has from the list of \nameref{start_equipment} (\vpageref{start_equipment}).
  \item\label{sumCCcoin}
  Starting money is $(3D6-5)\times 2^N$\gls{cp}, where N = combined levels in all Skills.
  \item\label{sumCCder}
  Fill in the derived stats, like \glspl{ap}, \glspl{hp}, and (if you have armour) \gls{dr}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \glspl{hp} are equal to 6 plus your Strength.
    \item
    \glspl{fp} are equal to total \glspl{xp} divided by 10 (rounded up), plus Charisma.
    \item
    \glspl{mp} are equal to the number of Spheres you have times 3.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Concept}
\index{Concept}

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{attribute}}
indicate your past.
Strength might indicate working on a farm.
A high Charisma Bonus may indicate a creative past, such as poetry, or working with the public, trading or selling items.
Intelligent characters may have required to plan a lot -- perhaps working as a seneschal for a town \gls{warden}, or planning a safe route for a travelling circus.
Low intelligence means never having to think, so they may come from \pgls{warden} family, or started as a high-ranking \gls{server}, with someone else doing the book-keeping.
Dexterous characters could have been an expert weaver, before joining the \gls{guard}; or perhaps they lived in a major city and stole money from others.

\subsubsection{Joining the \glsfmttext{guard}}
happens for all number of reasons.
Did you naively sign up for a thrilling adventure, and now regret it?
Or are you another, standard, criminal, in the only place without standards?

\subsubsection{Other Temples}
sometimes send people out beyond the \gls{edge}, but be careful with these concepts.
Such a character must have a reason to routinely join \gls{guard} missions, and listen to \glspl{jotter}.

Take your character's history, and condense it into two words.
