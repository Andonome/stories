\label{ngIntroductions}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Introduce your character to the group, and describe what they look like.
The \gls{guard} have no uniform exactly, but they do have a standard `look', due to commonalities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Darkened leather (or a black tabard), hides them in the dark.
  \item
  A special scabbard with a `v-split' along one side, allows the \glspl{guard} to carry a sword on their back, and comfortably draw it.
  \item
  Long hair means they can pull out a strand, to be used as a suture.
  \item
  Large, black, backpack with side-pouches.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Rank}
\label{ngRank}
\index{Rank in the \glsentrytext{guard}}
New characters start with a rank equal to the highest ranking member of the troupe, because life's not fair.
If everyone's new, then everyone begins as `fodder'.

Welcome to the \gls{guard}!

\subsubsection{First Words}

You have arrived in \pgls{broch}, ready for your first mission.
It's time for introductions, and to ask the \gls{jotter} if you can have one more piece of equipment from the \nameref{start_equipment}, \vpageref{start_equipment}.
Roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} at \tn[7].

\paragraph{If you succeed,}
think of how your character would do well in a social situation, and describe the result before writing the item on your character sheet.

\paragraph{If you fail,}
describe how your character might fumble the request.
Do they misunderstand the situation, or do they just have a bad attitude?

\paragraph{If you tie,}
think of how your character might fumble, then reverse course.
The jotter gives them the next item on the list, and explains why you should \emph{in fact} use that.

During the game, you can use a dice-roll to indicate that you have something to say.
Just roll, and use the result as a guide to your character's reaction.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{rollForRoles}
Of course, the \gls{gm} may give you a rather different \gls{tn}\ldots

\section{Self Made Characters}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\label{playerchosen}

\noindent
If players prefer, they can design their own characters by simply setting all Attributes to 0, then applying the racial modifiers.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{sumCCrace}
  Select a race.
  \item\label{sumCCatt}
  Set each of your Attributes to 0, then apply the racial bonuses and penalties (\autopageref{raceRoll}).
  \item\label{sumCCconcept}
  Write down a concept and background culture from your campaign.
  \item\label{sumCCcode}
  Select a Code to follow, so you can gain \glspl{xp} (\autopageref{codes}).
  \item\label{sumCCxp}
  Spend 50 \gls{xp} on Attributes, Skills, and Knacks (see \autopageref{xpCosts} for the costs).
  \item\label{sumCCequip}
  Take 1 item per Skill level your character has from the list of starting equipment.
  \item\label{sumCCcoin}
  Starting money is $(3D6-5)\times 2^S$\gls{cp}, where S = combined levels in all Skills.
  \item\label{sumCCder}
  Fill in the derived stats, like \gls{dr} (0 if you have no armour), \glspl{ap}, \glspl{hp}, et c.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \glspl{hp} are equal to 6 plus your Strength.
    \item
    \glspl{fp} are equal to total \glspl{xp} divided by 10 (rounded up), plus Charisma.
    \item
    \glspl{mp} are equal to the number of Spheres you have times 3.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Concept}
\index{Concept}

Have a look at your character's Attributes and consider what kind of person they are.
Strength might indicate working on a farm.
A good Charisma may indicate a creative past, such as poetry, or working with the public, trading or selling items.
Intelligent characters may have required to plan a lot -- perhaps working as a seneschal for a town \gls{warden}, or planning a safe route for a travelling circus.
Low intelligence means never having to think, so they may come from \pgls{warden} family, or always worked in a stonemason's guild, where someone else could plan their day for them.
Dexterous characters could have been an expert weaver, before joining the \gls{guard}; or perhaps they lived in a major city and stole money from others.

How did you end up in the \gls{guard}?
Did you naively sign up for a thrilling adventure, and now regret it?
What happened to your farm?
Torched by goblins, or did too many men leave the \gls{village}?
Most join simply because they did not inherit their parents' land, so they hope to make some money, and perhaps be rewarded with land.
Some stole or robbed from people, and managed to plead to a judge to let them join the \gls{guard} instead of hanging.

Take your character's history, and condense it into two words.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Betrayed \Gls{server}
  \item
  Crypto Zoologist
  \item
  Dispossessed Farmer
  \item
  Dishonoured \Gls{doula}
  \item
  Dauntless Youth
  \item
  Failed \Gls{scribe}
  \item
  Lazy Thief
  \item
  Lost Writer
  \item
  Reformed Bandit
  \item
  \Gls{warden}'s bastard
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Starting Equipment}

Characters each start with one items per Skill level.
If your character has Combat 1, and Caving 2, they can select 3 items from standard \nameref{start_equipment}, \vpageref{start_equipment}.

\subsubsection{Starting Money}

The amount of bare money a character starts out with depends upon their Skills.
Starting money is $3D6-5$~\glspl{cp}, which doubles for every level the characters has in any Skill.

For example, a character with Empathy~1 and Tactics~2 might roll a total of~7.
$7\times2\times3 = 42$, so the character starts out with 42~\glspl{cp}.
