\chapter{Talisman Workshop}

With the right ingredients, one-use items (`talismans') can contain a single spell, useable once.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  A talisman requires double the \glspl{mp} that the spell would require.
  \item
  At lest half the \glspl{mp} for the talisman must come from magical ingredients.
  \item
  Talismans must be made from the right ingredients for the elemental spheres involved.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Air]
    uses contained gasses, often held in a phial.
    \item[Earth]
    requires any solid materials dug from the ground.
    \item[Fate]
    talismans require the remains of someone who had \glspl{fp} in life (at least 1 per \gls{mp} cost of the spell).
    \item[Fire]
    requires flammable material.
    \item[Water]
    can use any liquid.
  \end{description}
  Spells which employ multiple spheres must employ multiple ingredients.
  \item
  The alchemical process requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Alchemy} check, \tn[7] plus the spell's cost.
  \item
  Spells are cast with a bonus equal to their \gls{mp} cost, so an Air spell with a cost of 3 \glspl{mp}, made into a talisman, cast with a straight +3 bonus, rather than a roll of \roll{Charisma}{Air}.
  \item
  A \textit{Detailed Witness} spell, employing all of the correct spheres, can ask about whether the contained spell employs particular Enhancements or Effects.
  The \gls{tn} for this effect is 7 plus the spell's \gls{mp}
\end{itemize}
