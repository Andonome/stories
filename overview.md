# Enhancements

Enhancements should each come with their own problems when cast too high.

- Colourful
    * Actually no problems here, the spell just looks weird.
- Large
    * Too much fire or ice will target the wrong people, or make a monstrous animal. Too much desire in a rat makes it intelligent, and too much bear in a person will turn them into a bear.
- Twisted
    * Too much twisting will stop the item serving the same purpose as its basic nature turns to something else.
- Twisted:
