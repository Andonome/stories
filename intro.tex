\chapter{Preface}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Players at my table always needed the \textit{Core Rules} at the same time, either to check how to spend \glspl{xp}, or see what they could do with their \glspl{storypoint}.
So those rules have been ripped out the \textit{Core Rules} and put here, to save time and paper.

Before the start is a tour of \gls{fenestra}.
We begin with how to make your character, in \nameref{character_rolls}, then details on the character's culture.
Next, \nameref{stories} lets you add allies and aspects from your past.
\nameref{codes} shows how to gain \glspl{xp} at the end of a session.

For the most intrepid of witches, with an eye for the mysteries of Metaphysics, \nameref{witchcraft} allows you to build spells, \glspl{boon}, and \glspl{talisman} during \gls{downtime}.
