\subsection*{Overview}

The \textit{Book of Stories} covers everything BIND players need to build a \glsentrytext{pc}, and all the rules of more interest to the players than the \glsentrytext{gm}.
For the complete rules, find a copy of BIND \textit{Core}.

\begin{description}
  \item[\nameref{randomCharacterCreation}]
  lets you build a random character with seven rolls of $2D6$.
  \item[\nameref{playerchosen}]
  details how to make your own character, with decisions at every stage.
  \item[\nameref{listOfStories}] shows how to spend \glspl{storypoint} to flesh out a character's backstory, then introduce allies.
  You can create these allies just like your \gls{pc}, and when your \gls{pc} dies, select a new one from your pool of allies.
  \item[\nameref{listOfCodes}] introduces the Codes of Belief that players can use to gain additional \glspl{xp}.
  \item[\nameref{races}] details the cultural norms of the peoples of \gls{fenestra}.
\end{description}


\subsection*{Take Care, Don't Play Fair}

The world of BIND doesn't play fair, and neither should you.
Your character will feel tired, hungry, and may become lost in the dark forest.
They may die before you get to know them, so don't get too attached.

These characters will live in the forest, where all the creatures of \gls{fenestra} think of them as prey.
Metal doesn't come cheaply, so you may have to make do with a dagger and rotten, second-hand armour.

BIND won't play fair, but it does play by the rules, and you can exploit that.
Can't carry enough goods?
Hire someone else to carry them, buy a donkey, or `liberate' one from a farmer as payment.
Can't enter town due to your rank?
Stand outside, and ask traders to purchase something for you.
Can't fight properly with the dagger?
Use a shovel, or make a club from a tree-branch and rusty nails!
Too many beasts about to stay safe?
Buy some pitch, and start burning trees!
