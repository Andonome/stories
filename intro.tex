\chapter{Preface}

\noindent
Players at my table always needed the \textit{Core Rules} at the same time, either to check how to spend \glspl{xp}, or see what they could do with their \glspl{storypoint}.
So those rules have been ripped from the \textit{Core Rules} and put here, to save time and paper.

BIND has four ways to make a character.
The first and fastest is to take a pre-generated \gls{pc} from the \gls{gm} (each module comes with a few).
This method takes about 2 seconds.

The second method is covered in \autoref{randomCharacterCreation} -- roll up a completely random character, with a random name, race, \glspl{trait} and equipment.
This takes about five minutes to roll the dice and write down the results.

Now that you have a character, you can spend \glspl{storypoint} to introduce allies, family, or drinking buddies from your past.
This person will accompany you for a single session, at most, then leaves.
Each character you introduce remains in your \gls{characterPool}, so when the first character dies, you can select one as your primary \gls{pc}.

Finally, players with a specific character in mind can spend more \glspl{storypoint} to specify exactly the ally they want.
This it best done before a game begins, leaving lots of time to select the right \glspl{trait}, name, and concept.
