\mapentry[beJester]{The \glsfmttext{warden} smiles}
a new smile and asks the jester where his mirth has gotten to.
The jester stutters for a second, and you start to stutter over him, mocking the jokeless jester.

\begin{speechtext}
  I have reached two verdicts; a release, and a sentence.
  The jester has reached the end of his term.

  \emph{I release you from your post.  Leave my court by night.}

  Now, funny man, with funny sentences, I have a funny sentence for you\ldots

  \emph{Jurors, meet the newest jester!}
\end{speechtext}
