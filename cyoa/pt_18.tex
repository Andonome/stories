\mapentry[moreCrawlers]{The crowd goes completely fucking nuts}
for an eternity.
And once the cries recede, the \glspl{sunGuard} around the top start throwing down weapons --- a massive sword, a halberd, and then armour.
Proper chainmail.

``\textit{Hurry up and stick on the armour!}'', they say.

All the gates open at once, and the crowd picks up again.
And you have to wonder how they have all these \glspl{monster} ready to go, but it looks like you'll never find out.
