you walk until the firelight, ahead.
The walls have four corridors, with metal gates, including yours.
Above the walls, a copper cage, curling over the top, to protect the `jury'.

Your gate falls, blocking the exit.
Someone climbs the copper cage at the far end of the \gls{court}, shouting ``ooOOoooh!'' and jingling.
Jesters always jingle.

``This one's ahead of schedule'', he says to the \gls{warden}, who sits in judgement at the far end.
Then he turns to the crowd.

``You know I like it when they're eager.''

The crowd laughs.
Some clap.

``Now the excuses!
Go on.
Tell us excuses.
Something pretty and new.''
