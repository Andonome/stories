and \pgls{sunGuard} leads him out -- \composeHumanName\ -- the man so foolish, he thought he could win something in the \gls{court}.
He steps out, confused, but confident as ever, longsword in hand.
The \gls{sunGuard} walks over to hand you a longsword.

Make \pgls{combat} roll: $2D6$ plus \roll{Dexterity}{Melee} at \tn[11].
Add another +2~Bonus for having a longsword.

  You can spend \glspl{fp} to reduce the Damage, but after the \glspl{fp}, that blade parts your flesh.}%

  \willYe{Roll 11}%
  {and you can decide to deal and receive Damage, or neither.}%
  {}
  \willYe{Roll over 11}%
  {and you cut him, dealing \dmg{0}~Damage plus your Strength~Bonus, plus 2 for the longsword.
  Once you deal 7 Damage, you win.}%
