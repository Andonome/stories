\mapentry[whispers]{Listen Well}
it says.
`My voice grows weak'.
Then a dagger flies through the crack.
To dodge, roll $2D6$, then add your \gls{pc}'s \roll{Wits}{Brawl}.

\begin{selectPath}
  \willYe{Roll 9}%
  {and you jump back in time, angry but safe.}%
  {}
  \willYe{Roll above 9}%
  {and you grab the dagger.}%
  {}
  \willYe{Roll under 9}%
  {and the dagger cuts into your kneck, inflicting \dmg{2}~Damage.}%
  {}
\end{selectPath}

Nothing to do now but lie down in that straw.
Once morning comes, a little luck returns.
Gain $1D6$ \glspl{fp}, then turn to part \vref{morning}.
