it says.
`My voice grows weak'.
Then a dagger flies through the crack.
To dodge, roll $2D6$, the add your \gls{pc}'s \roll{Wits}{Brawl}.
The \gls{tn} is `9'.

\begin{description}
  \item[Roll 9]
  and you jump back in time, angry but safe.
  \item[Roll above 9]
  and you grab the dagger.
  \item[Roll under 9]
  and the dagger cuts into your kneck, inflicting \dmg{2}~Damage.
  Damage reduces your \glspl{fp} until you have none left, then it reduces your \glspl{hp}.
\end{description}

Nothing to do now but lie down in that straw.
Once morning comes, a little luck returns.
Gain $1D6$ \glspl{fp}, then turn to part \vref{morning}.
