now that the excitement has passed.
The \gls{warden} speaks.

\begin{speechtext}
  ``Given the plain facts, and your unruly behaviour, justice demands you repay your debts.
  You may pay 100~\glsfmtlongpl{sp} to the \gls{templeOfBeasts}.

  The \glspl{sunGuard} will furnish you with the traditional black cloak, and return any other possessions.

  From this day forth, you no longer have the right to live among civilized people, but must stay up in the \glspl{broch}, and walk along the \gls{lonelyRoad}.''
\end{speechtext}

Show's over.
The jurors give a round of applause, and start buying snacks over the ten minute interlude.
