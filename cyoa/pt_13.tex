\mapentry[throwDagger]{Stepping closer}
you protest your innocence so that nobody wonders why you're walking closer.
The \gls{court}'s high walls mean that every \gls{step} forward lets you see less of the high \gls{warden}.
But at twenty \glspl{step} away, you still see the head, so you pull the dagger from your boots.

The crowd gasps.
Roll \roll{Dexterity}{Projectiles} at \tn[11].
