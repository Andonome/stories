The metaphysics of BIND's magic comes from Greece, and ultimately from Aristotle.
Most magic systems I would say are fundamentally Aristotelian.
A person has a form, and a substance - the stone spell changes the substance, but retains the form.
Similarly, spells have an innate 'telos', or 'thing they are made to do' - fireballs burn, charm spells charm, et c.

Anyone transformed to stone would retain their organs with the same telos, meaning that a liver would continue to process toxins, and the eyes continue to see, because that's what eyes are for (regardless of their 'substantive cause' (meaning, the substance they are made from).
Similarly, when a spell makes someone big, they wouldn't have problems with vision, their lungs won't collapse, and they won't suffer any back-pain, because they are the same as they were, except for the size, which is simply a larger version of their original form, with more substance added via the magic of the growth spell.

If none of that makes sense, blame Aristotle.
