This repository will slowly become the rules for magic.

Broadly, it should work like this:

1. Players receive simple spells on their sheet.
    * Spells show something like this:
    * **Party-Kill: Fire 2, Area: Room, Range: 5 steps.**
    * *Snuff out all the fire in a room*
2. All spells should be created with an underlying spell-system.
    * Players who want to read all the rules should have a very clear idea of how to create spells on the fly.
3. I have no idea how magical items are going to function, but the rules need to have fewer steps than the current system.

# Changes

## Attribute Emphasis

- Standard magic will use Charisma as the base stat. Spellcasters will coax plants, by speaking to them sweetly, or demand a fire banish itself.
- A Fast-Casting Knack will be available to use Wits to cast even faster spells, allowing uncharismatic casters to exist.
- A Ritual-Casting Knack knack will allow casters to use Intelligence, and to gain obscene amounts of Mana by casting long rituals (up to 10 MP).

## Nura

The new magic system cannot have nura as humanoids transformed and twisted.
Instead, the nura will simply be their own people, who come from another realm.

## Flesh

Instead of polymorph, the generic Noun will be 'flesh'.
Casters will alter, destroy, and create flesh.

Fitting this into the current system will (unfortunately) mean that the system has healing magic.
This will have to be heavily limited.
Healing spells cast on someone will have the usual high TN, and they will not heal much - perhaps only a number of HP equal to the MP spent.

## No Lights

There is no 'light' sphere.
Illusions will be made from almost any sphere when someone casts a 'complex' spell.
Casters could summon light from fire, but it's not clear if the system will support long-term were-lights, floating about the place.

# Structure

The book will be formatted after spells, items, et c. each have clear definitions.
For now, we have

- [The basic rules](rules.md)
- [A list of spells](spell_list.md)
- [A list of basic every basic combination, to check they all make sense](overview.md) (wip)
