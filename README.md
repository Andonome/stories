*The Book of Stories* contains all the procedures a player might need for the BIND tabletop RPG.

# Getting the Book

Download the [pdf][stories] then take it to your local, friendly, print-shop.
Everything in the book has been optimized for reading on paper.
Reading two-columns of blinding-white PDF on a monitor will only give you a headache.

## Compiling the Book Yourself

To compile the books with LaTeX, check the setup in the [wiki][compiling].

## Contents

Inside, players can find:

- How to make random characters.
- How to make bespoke characters.
- Building a backstory with Story Points.
- Gaining and spending XP.
- Details on each race's cultural norms.
