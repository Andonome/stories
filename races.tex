\section[Dwarves]{Dwarves \Dw}
\index{Dwarves}
\label{dwarvishHomes}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\renewcommand\npcsymbol{\Dw}

\subsection{Settlements}

Far underground, below the soil or coiled up within mountains, the underwyrms roam. Some are as long as a castle, while others stretch only the length of a few horses. Their head is that of a streamlined lizard, and they snake, limbless through the bowls of the world, jutting aside or just eating earth and stone. They feed on a combination of minerals, rocks and the underground fungi. And in their path they leave wide, wide tunnels.

After the tunnels are formed, little dwarves follow on -- strengthening them with properly placed stone arrayed into an arch or packing the tunnel with clay and then setting a fire of mushrooms, underwyrm droppings and underground oil. Then they carve and chisel for decades until they have a hall or room fit to house a dwarf, or a deep fungal garden, powered by an underground lake or river.

Almost all dwarvish communities are based around underground lakes -- many are boating folk, though they do not understand the open sea, or its wind and tides. You know where you stand with a dwarvish lake -- you stand still. It is often at the centre of the lake that one finds the day-bell, a massive bell which forms the pride and heart of any dwarvish community. The day bell rings after 20 hours to say that work has finished and then again 8 hours later to say that work has started again. Many communities buck this trend one way or the other, depending upon the whims of their queen.

The outsides of a dwarvish citadel (or `undertown') are reinforced with metals and very dense clays to discourage outsiders digging in.
Dwarves have an excellent knowledge of where is dangerous, what might collapse and how to reinforce walls (or pull them down in a hurry).

Alcohol forms a massive part of dwarvish culture, but not as many know it.
They use it primarily for light or cooking, as it gives less smoke than other fuels.
Dwarves, they say, can ferment anything -- living oozes, fungi, goblins.
All life underground eventually converts to light.%
\footnote{Dwarvish saying: \textit{`If it lives, it can die. When it dies, it rots. If it rots, you can burn it'}.}

Commonly, dwarvish tunnels to the outside will end in a gnome-warren.
Direct contact with the outside world, opening into a forest or plain, is seen as `letting the sun in',
and generally frowned upon, but if the dwarvish tunnel ends in a gnomish warren and those gnomes happen to let the sun in, well -- that's \emph{their} business.
This persistent crossing of paths means that the dwarvish and gnomish languages are very similar, and patient speakers of one can mostly understand the other.

\subsubsection{Structure}
Dwarvish society is heavily matriarchal -- only around one in every ten dwarves is female, so most never marry.
Women stand at the heads of their society and are generally considered too precious to go above ground for the menial tasks of trading for food or cutting down wood.
Rich males compete in fashioning the most exquisite jewellery in order to win the hand of a fair, dwarvish maiden (or indeed, any dwarvish maiden).

\subsection{Commerce}

Dwarves are famed for their exceptional armour, being the first to invent full plate armour, and still the best at creating it.
They can enter combat fearlessly, knowing that little except an underwyrm can penetrate their thick, steel plates.

What is less well known is the dwarvish skill at farming -- mushrooms, glow-worms for lanterns, underground jellies which feed on water and slime -- all manner of underground delicacies are created deep below the earth (though it seems only dwarves actually find them palatable).

\subsection{Warfare}

Dwarves fight with spears, swords, and smoke.

When defending a large entrance, dwarves set themselves up with crossbows, then hand the crossbows back.
Others behind them reload the crossbows in a production line, then hand it back.

While rudimentary crossbow-string might be made from watchers' tendrils, the best comes from hemp.
Dwarves can construct the rest of the item from wood or umberhulk chitin.

When narrower tunnels eventually demand toe-to-toe combat, dwarves always fight with spears or swords (which humans irritatingly refer to as `short swords').
They bring all the nastiest, burnable material they can to a battlefield, such as specially dried mushrooms, or wood, and lay it around the start of a narrow tunnel where they intend to fight.
They stab a little with their spears, then retreat while lighting the fires underneath them.

Dwarves often wet their beards before battle, to protect them from flames.

\subsection{Inheritance}

\subsubsection[Tenacity: dwarves take only half the usual penalties from rotten food, poisons, or foul air.]{Tenacity}
\label{dwarvenInheritance}

Dwarves are bred on the most acrid substances -- they eat tough, deep mushrooms and occasionally munch on acidic jellies (after thoroughly cooking them).
Dwarven ales are classified as spirits by any sane human and dwarven spirits are generally classified as poisons by all other races.
The same applies to bad air.

Dwarves take half Damage or \glspl{ep} from any given poison or gas.
They suffer no ill effects from eating rotten food (though it may not count as being nutritious) and the \gls{gm} is encouraged to allow them to eat anything that might otherwise be damaging, within reasonable limits.

\subsubsection{Taciturn}

Dwarves trust others slowly, and like to remain formal when first meeting people.
In gaming terms, they cannot spend \glspl{storypoint} during the first session.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{ingredient}}

\index[mana]{Fire!Dwarves}
Dwarven beards make an excellent Fire \gls{ingredient}.
Older dwarves, with a long beard, sometimes provide two.

Of course, dwarves never like to speak about this, and often dismiss this as a rumour, designed to make trouble between dwarves and \glspl{doula}.

\subsection{Enlistment}

Dwarves join the \gls{guard} for the same reasons as anyone else -- a criminal background, a propensity for violence, and hope of gold.
And each one in the \gls{guard} carries some plan for that gold, even if they never voice it.
Because at the end of the day, it's never about the gold -- it's about what you plan to do with it.

\subsection{Roleplaying Dwarves}
\index{Dwarves!Roleplaying}

Check then double-check.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Does this person really know where the lost temple lies?
  Ask him about the rooves, doors, and other items made of wood.
  If the temple was lost three centuries ago, those constructions must have degraded.
  Does his story match?
  \item
  Have you really made your point clear?
  Tell him again what will happen if he fails to pay your money back, but \emph{louder}.
  \item
  Does the beer taste good?
  A really good beer still tastes good when you drink three in a row.
  \item
  When the guide says he will lead you all to the lost city, does he mean `within visual range', or `up to the gate', or `to the actual monument, in the centre'?
  Is that written in the contract?
  \item
  Do we have enough torches for this mission?
  If the last crew took two hours to journey down, and three hours back up, and if each torch burns for one hour, then you will need at least five torches for the journey, and one to look around for an hour.
  Best bring ten.

  Share the torches among your companions, so that if you lose one, the group still has enough torches.
  \item
  Has the bandit really died?
  Stab him in the neck, just to make sure.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Write yourself a reminder to double-check this section at the start and end of every session, to make sure you have put it into practice.}

\section[Elves]{Elven Glades \El}
\index{Elves}
\label{elvenGlades}

\widePic{Studio_DA/elf_stalker}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\renewcommand\npcsymbol{\El}

\noindent
Elves array themselves in a circular fashion around a sacred spot where mana springs up from the ground like a wellspring.
Typically, elves base their society around `underglass' houses.
They first excavate the entire house with two openings to the top -- one as an exit and the other as an above-ground window.
The window is composed of thick glass -- thick enough for a herd of deer to gallop across.
It lets in sunlight during the day, and at night, when elvish hearths bloom, little lights can be seen across the forest bed as the fire-light shines out of the underglass houses.

Elvish homes are sometimes solitary but more often linked -- they will share chimneys (which leak above ground, sometimes through a tree), exits and often a couple of communal rooms.

Travelling elves often take griffins as their mounts. Rather than capture and tame them, they are expected, through natural magical talent, to instantly befriend them and leave them when the journey is over. The human method of keeping animals in a long-term manner, who then cannot fend for themselves is considered clumsy at best and cruel at worst. Elves pick up what they need as they go and discard it just as quickly.

Elves live for long years -- sometimes up to a millennium -- and as a result become skilled artisans.
Most of this time is often spent simply lounging about, but if they bother even once in five years to make an artistic piece then the forest is soon peppered with little artistic pieces.
Trees carved (or magically shaped) into depictions of battles, or the face of a famously handsome elvish enchanter, or just intricate patterns of knots and spirals carved into stone, so often make an elvish glade look like an art-show.
Some communities put the rubbish outside and leave the best pieces for the sacred centre of the community, where outsiders may not go.
Others leave the centre empty, saving the best pieces for the outskirts of the village and throw the mediocre pieces away.

Elvish communities seldom reach above a population of one hundred.
Those that do are always based around some Tree Master who can grow huge amounts of food magically.
The majority stay as low as twenty folk who travel long distances between communities.

\subsubsection{Structure}

Elves are fiercely individualistic, and do not hold with the concept of leaders or gods.
Rather, they have a society based around experts.
In matters concerning hunting, the master hunter will make all group decisions.
In matters concerning statues, the master carver will make communal decisions.
Each expert has their own strict domain of influence.
Many elves translate these `masters' as `king' or `land warden' when speaking with human, and as a result nearly half the elves abroad in human lands claim to be the children of royalty -- exactly how accurate this is depends upon one's interpretation.

\subsection{Commerce}

Many people think that elves won't trade with anyone due to snobbery.
But in truth, the elves rarely trade with anyone, because nobody has the time.

\subsubsection{Jewellery}

Elvish trade is based mostly on jewellery -- one can tell how rich an elf is (or was) by the number of piercings they have.
Typically these will be in the ears, but torso piercings are also common.
Rings, necklaces, brooches and all manner of other precious art pieces adorn most elves with any interest in commerce.

The value of jewellery depends on its history -- having a famous maker increases the value, as does a history of being worn during a famous battle, or just by a famous elf.
While trading, elves will explain the complete history of each item, in order to ascertain its worth.
During this time, the seller expects the buyer to sit silently and listen, without reaction.
This custom arose so that buyers who already know about the history of an item can corroborate what the seller tells them, and then inform other elves if the seller's information matches, or does not match.
This chain of listening, comparing, and noting others' reputations keeps the system consistent.%
\footnote{Consistency is often more important than truth.}

While most traders don't have a day or two to simply look at people's wares, some of them manage to break the system.
Gnomes often set up deals through a series of letters (which they then show to others, rather than repeating a long conversation), and some gnolls manage to conclude deals simply by {\small speaking-incredibly-fast} and hurrying the seller along.

\subsubsection{Songs}

Songs form a kind of second currency, as jewellery is rarely traded for music, and vice-versa.
Instead, elves trade a songs for songs.

Elves often lock a lot of their knowledge in songs, including spells, \gls{area}-knowledge, gossip,%
\footnote{What human refer to as `history', elves refer to as `gossip'.}
recipes, and hunting techniques.

\subsection{Warfare}

Elves don't like to be rushed, so when surprise battles come, they flee wherever possible, then reconsider their options at length.

As a society of specialists, most elven settlements will only have a few people with martial knowledge, such as archers with Air magic, and enchanter, or someone with Life, capable of summoning massive animals to attack the enemy.

When on the attack, elves prefer guerilla warfare, sneaking out to set fire to buildings, or ruin crops.
Those with Life magic often encourage massive amounts of plant growth in an area, covering a field in thorny bushes, or even blocking site.

\subsection{Inheritance}

\subsubsection[Thermal Apathy: take no penalties from natural weather.]{Thermal Apathy}
\label{elvenInheritance}

Elves are creatures of the natural world -- they are in tune with the rhythms of the forests and planes and never harmed by them.
Elves are immune to \glspl{ep} from natural heat levels -- they can sleep outside in the snow or wander deserts without sunburn.
Additionally, they do not sleep but instead require only four hours' meditation per day.
During these times, elves relive their old memories as a way of hanging onto the very old ones so as to not forget who they are.

\subsubsection{Longevity}

Elves age but not because they are degrading, rather because they are changing.
Over the years they become progressively more fay looking and alien.
Their minds sharpen, but their bodies degrade.
After 100 years, an elf's maximum Strength Bonus decreases from +2 to +1 but their maximum Dexterity increases to +4.
At 200 years old the elf's maximum Strength score becomes 0 but their maximum Speed Bonus raises to +4.
At 300 the elf's maximum Strength Bonus is -1 but they can move their Intelligence up to +4.
Finally, at 400 years old the elf's Charisma Bonus becomes +4 and their maximum Strength becomes -2.

  \begin{boxtable}[XcX]

    Age & Max. Strength & Increase \\\hline

    100 & +1 & Dexterity \\

    200 & 0 & Speed \\

    300 & -1 & Intelligence \\

    400 & -2 & Charisma \\

  \end{boxtable}

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{ingredient}}

\index[mana]{Water!Elves}

Five elven tears provide enough for a Water \gls{ingredient}.
Unfortunately, shedding tears also drains elves of all \glspl{mp}, so elves quickly learn to withdraw from unpleasant feelings.

\Glspl{pc} can elect to cry on command by spending \pgls{storypoint}, in order to call upon a tragic memory.

\subsection{Starting Characters}

Player characters will start as younger elves, without the experience, keen intellect and amazing skill-set of their elders. Many adventure in order to gain the experience they see in their elders. Others simply want to see what the world has to offer. Still others want to learn a specific skill, perhaps to master the sword or a specific magic Sphere.

Elves tend to view their own young as expendable.
They do not reproduce rapidly, but over long centuries a single elf can easily have many children.
Since the youth tend to be stronger than their elders, these young things are encouraged to perform the most dangerous of tasks such as hunting large animals or defending a village through m\^{e}l\'{e}e rather than with a bow.
As a result of this attitude, elves encourage many of their young to go out into the world and seek knowledge before they become old, frail and strange.

\subsection{Roleplaying Elves}
\index{Elves!Roleplaying}

The various elven languages have no words for `good', `bad', or `evil'.
As a result, elves to not fully understand or use these words, even when speaking other languages.

Bread cannot `go bad' -- it has mould.
They will never call a song `good' -- the song feels lively, or sounds like a Sunrise, or makes one think of home.
They would never call someone `evil' -- they might say `destructive' or `useless', or `selfish', but never use language which characterizes anything with such a wide notion as `good' or `bad'.

If someone says `your plan sounds good', make sure to clarify if they mean that they want the results of the plan, or if the plan seems likely to succeed, or if the plan has been stated clearly.
And when you hear something is `bad', clarify that too.

\end{multicols}

\section[Gnolls]{Gnoll Hunting Grounds \Nl}
\index{Gnolls}
\label{GnollishGrounds}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\renewcommand\npcsymbol{\Nl}

\noindent
Only the gnolls have the strength and wits to live above-ground, without walls.
They breed dogs, and most keep a few, so that a group of 20 gnolls will often have around 100 of these fierce hunting dogs.
They keep watch, sometimes prowling around the outskirts, sometimes simply keeping their ears up, but the camp never has fewer than 40 active sentries about.

Smaller groups hunt.
Larger groups generally herd animals, and can be heard a long way off, due to the combined noise of aurochs, goats, sheep, and gossip.

People change from one clan to another depending upon romantic partners or where they find themselves.
The various mobile clans sometimes fight, but always come together when an outsider invades their territory.

\subsubsection{Structure}
Organization comes through a strange and hyperactive kind of gossip.
It never ends, but when serious decisions arise about where the tribe should go, or whether it should fight, the gossip reaches incredible speed.
Every gnoll speaks at once, to all sitting beside them, in a short, hurried fashion, acknowledging and expanding upon others' points.
This process goes on for anywhere for twenty minutes to a full night and day.

By the end, an consensus has been reached.
Nobody knows exactly how the process works, or what kind of governance to call it.
Outsiders only know that when gnolls start talking, nobody else can keep up.

\subsection{Commerce}

Gnolls primarily trade meat with dwarves and humans, who can never get enough of their own.
They also trade hunting dogs, but charge a high price, and always make sure that the buyer promises to look after the animal properly.
These promises should be kept, as gnolls will take note of how buyers care for their animals.
Humans sometimes complain they don't really understand `property', and the gnolls generally don't sell to those humans.

Gnolls sometimes take coinage, but prefer jewellery, as it can be worn, and does not require additional preparation, like money-sacks.

\subsection{Warfare}

Gnolls almost universally employ guerilla tactics.
They set settlements on fire, attack supply lines, and generally poke at every weakness which comes from living in a fixed location.

Massive castle walls daunt gnolls deeply, so they prefer not to attack large civilizations, but if they must do so then they always focus on attacking supply lines, while moving in small groups around the area, encircling it with tiny groups.

\subsection{Inheritance}

\subsubsection[Teeth: grab and grapple in a single manoeuvre]{Teeth}
\label{gnollishInheritance}

Gnolls, like wolves, can grab and damage in a single attack by sinking their teeth into a target.
This deals $1D6 + Str$ Damage.


\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{ingredient}}

\index[mana]{Air!Gnolls}

A gnoll's intestines, properly prepared, can provide an Air \gls{ingredient}.
Gnoll druids typically extract intestines from the dead because.
Others refer to this as a `death ritual', but in fact, gnolls simply value practicality, and rarely bother with rituals.

\subsection{Enlistment}

Gnolls have no `criminals' within their own society (every crime has a fast ultimatum, and possible redemption or death), but those corrupted by human society still end up in the \gls{guard} when breaking the law.

Other gnolls sign up voluntarily.
Being faster and fitter than humans, they stand a better chance than most at survival.

\section[Gnomes]{Gnomish Warrens \Gn}
\label{gnomishWarrens}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\renewcommand\npcsymbol{\Gn}

\widePic{Roch_Hercka/illusion_trogdor}

\index{Gnomes}
\noindent
Gnomes live in little warrens, under the ground, but enjoy lots of sunlit openings near the edge of their warren.
Their network of tunnels and homes extend often up to fifty feet below the ground.
These little communities often keep two-level farms -- they tunnel beneath what others consider to be good farmland and then pull cabbages, potatoes, carrots and other rooting vegetables down from the ceiling rather than up from the earth.
They consider humans to be quite backwards, since the vegetables clearly emerge at the bottom when they are grown.

Gnomes take great pride in remaining `subtle' -- the openings to their houses are never glass but openings which can be closed in order to look as natural as possible -- the side of a hill may open to reveal a living room, or a large, apparently dead tree may have a door opening underground to a small pantry. Often, the only way to spot a gnomish warren once the doors are closed is to note the bountiful fields of good crops. Unfortunately many gnomish gardens are not strong enough to support a lot of weight. Many a `heavy thing' has fallen through the soil of a gnomish garden and found a number of gnomes wondering what to do with a wounded horse and a bemused human rider.

All warrens remain secure from the various creatures -- above and below -- that want to eat the inhabitants by the liberal use of traps.
Woodspies which probe a tentacle underground often accidentally grope a razor-sharp edge.
Chitincrawlers searching the grounds will find myriad entrances, all of which have blades pointing harmlessly inwards\ldots until the creature turns back, and finds the blades far more of a problem when trying to leave the narrow corridor.
A when dwarves decide to arrive fully-armoured in plate armour, for a rude visit, they may find a hallway dangling with string festooned with tiny hooks, just strong enough to snag on their helmets and distract from the cracks in the ceiling.

Gnomes always ensure that people can see their traps before steeping into them, partly because they make most traps to protect themselves from monsters, and partly because people feel much more confident and careless when they think they understand how a trap works.
Their \glspl{talisman} work similarly -- gnomes often write some activation work on their alchemical creations in the form of a riddle; this ensures that stupid people who don't speak their language cannot use the item, which functions to stop `bad people' using the item.%
\footnote{We all have our little prejudices, and the gnomish intellect does not make them an exception.}

The gnomish language is rather similar to dwarvish but can change almost as quickly as human languages.
They have three versions -- in addition to being able to speak and write, they can also whistle their language.
The language has a strict way of making sound shifts form normal sounds to whistling sounds.
This allows gnomes to communicate over massive distances -- over wide plains, mountains or through a mile or two of underground tunnels.
It also allows them to hold conversations between each other while standing right in front of people, as most people do not understand that when a gnome is whistling they are also probably saying something meaningful.
Or meaningless.
Gnomes are big fans of using language for its own sake. 

Upon greeting each other, gnomes do not give their names but ask for one -- customarily each person a gnome meets will have one name for them, and a group name will soon emerge for each different social circle. This causes no end of confusion when people ask a gnome what their name is, and the gnome takes this as a sign of an unimaginative companion, before giving the new friend a name without asking what they would like to be called.

\subsubsection{Structure}
Gnomish societies have complicated electoral systems where various members cast differing numbers of votes in order to elect to create various positions of government.
These positions are then voted upon with different voting systems, and a third is in place to decide how often votes will take place and how to vote on bringing in new voting systems.
This can take place with warrens with as few as ten gnomes, and often every member of the warren will be in government in some sense or another.
Any time a decision is called upon, gnomes will be delighted to help, and will often return a month later with an ornately carved flowchart of exactly how to determine `Step A' in the `decision-optimization adventure'.
And if nearby dwarves and elves ignore this advice, it's just further evidence that the other races are both impatient and a little stupid.

\subsection{Warfare}

When gnomes can flee, they do so, but otherwise nobody knows what they might do ahead of time.
They dislike repeated tactics or methods.
They prefer unpredictable plans to reliable ones, and often rely on details that people think of as inconsequential, such as what the enemy's shoe-laces are made from, or what the maximum tunnel-size the enemy can comfortably run through.
They might stop and draw a perfect square into the dirt with their finger before running away, leaving any half-sensible enemy to conclude that some hidden trap lies on the ground.
And if they know illusion magic, they always mix together illusory common beasts for the area, illusions of spells they could theoretically cast (and in fact can cast), and ensure all of these illusion have far less detail than they could on the first casting.

\subsection{Commerce}

Gnomes trade with a complicated arrangement of other race's coinage, promises, secrets, precious gemstones and paper. This paper money has its own value system which shifts depending upon who wrote the promised note and how well they have been trading recently. When dealing with other races, they try to find something of the native coinage, so as not to confuse the poor big people.

\subsection{Inheritance}

\subsubsection[Attentiveness: roll 2D6+3 for resting actions]{Attentiveness}
\label{gnomishInheritance}

Gnomes often have a hard time focussing on things, but once they successfully do so, they focus to the exclusion of all else, often with amazing results.
When gnomes take a Resting Action, rather than rolling $1D6$ and adding +6, they roll $2D6+3$.
If they want to change a failed action into a Resting Action, they add $1D6-3$ to their roll.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{ingredient}}

\index[mana]{Earth!Gnomes}

Gnome-bones can, when properly ground, provide \pgls{ingredient} for the Earth Sphere.
Many theorize that this explains why griffins seem to eager to eat them.%
\footnote{Gnomes have their own theory, but it makes for a bad story, so nobody can remember their claims.}

\subsection{Enlistment}

Gnomes are fairly adventure-averse as a rule, but have a knack of ending up on them by accident.
Many join the \gls{guard} to find rare \glspl{ingredient} for \glspl{talisman}.
Others join the \gls{paperGuild}, then steal some valuable book when they think nobody can see them, and end up in the \gls{guard}.

\subsection{Roleplaying Gnomes}

If Human things are `Human', and Dwarven things are `Dwarven', is my hat `Gnome' or `Gnomen'?
Can we apologize to the mage and make amends instead of killing her?
Can you use a hammer to communicate?
What else do shoes do?

Gnomes see the world from a different perspective.
They look up people`s noses all day.
Gnomes see the ceiling while others look down at the ground.

Gnomes travel slowly but it looks like a large space to them.
From a relative perspective, a travelling Gnome has travelled farther than the rest of the troupe.
Are we counting footsteps or miles?
Did you know that every mile has 5.280 feet?

Where did the mage commission her traps?
Is the architect still alive?
Does he have standard schematics for his traps in a workshop where he builds traps for people?

What kind of contract do you make when you sell someone a trap to guard their labyrinth?
What happens if I roll a boulder down the stairs?
Have these traps killed before?
Where do the bodies go?
Does someone climb down to get them out and do they use a ladder?

\section[Humans]{Human Towns \Hu}
\index{Humans}
\label{humanTowns}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\renewcommand\npcsymbol{\Hu}

\widePic{Leonard/next_day}

\noindent
Humans are large creatures with large, round, ears, who live above ground, despite the dangers.
Their massive arms let them build high wooden walls and dig deep ditches around their settlements, which keeps some of the forest beasts outside, but not all.
Other forest creatures crawl right over the houses at night, looking for younger humans to snatch.

Despite their size, the various beasts of the forest eat humans regularly, so populations must survive by having massive families.
Humans reproduce at an alarming rate -- instead of simply replacing themselves with two or three more humans, a couple might make as many as fourteen.
Of these, a good many will practice throughout their lives with the hunting bow, in order to protect their animals from forest creatures.

When enough humans form  together, a city often springs up in the centre, organically.
None of them organize where to build the city, it simply emerges around the middle of anywhere they can defend.
Once a city establishes itself in the area, humans will start to raise specialists who can practice at woodworking, book-binding, and other specialized skills.

Human languages are incredibly changeable and generally such a mess that they are not worth learning because of how quickly they change, walk a couple of towns away or wait a couple of centuries, and half the verbs suddenly change meaning.
This is mainly due to the fact that most humans never learn how to read.

\subsubsection{Structure}

Humans love hierarchies and are often confused about what they are doing if they cannot identify a nearby leader.
As a result, specialized decision-makers arise, usually inside cities, called `\glspl{warden}', who dictate what happens in a city, and distribute justice to criminals in a large court-house.

\subsection{Commerce}

Humans' massive feet and their habit of following each other creates massive roads.
Additionally, they trade live animals more often than hunted game, which creates more roads as cows, sheep, and goats trample down every possible route between human settlements.

They cannot craft their own alchemical spells, or good-quality armour, but the sheer quantity of goods they have to trade always lets them purchase these goods from others.

\subsection{Warfare}
Humans always rely on numbers in battle.
Coupled with their incredible size, they make a formidable force without much need for additional tactics.

Due to their slow minds, humans need to use simplified signals for battles, such as trumpets or flags, which can signal where everyone is meant to go.

\subsection{Inheritance}

\subsubsection[Long March: ignore first \glsentrytext{ep} from exercise]{Long March}
\label{humanInheritance}

Humans have great stamina when it comes to movement.
They can ignore the first \gls{ep} from any long marches.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{ingredient}}

\index[mana]{Fate!Humans}

Human blood, if distilled into an ink, and used in the right matter, can make for a good-quality Fate \gls{ingredient}.
Sometimes it makes for two \glspl{ingredient}, if the human had enough blood.

This process takes a long time, but the results speak for themselves, so many spell-casters will refuse to enter battle until they have enough humans to brew their blood-potions.

\subsection{Enlistment}

The \gls{guard} exists to ferry all the excess humans into the forest, to protect those who can plant and create.
They never need much of a reason to join the guard.

\subsection{Roleplaying Humans}
\index{Humans!Roleplaying}

If something doesn't work, humans just try a different method.
If they can't buy what they want, they often just steal.
When they can't figure out a spell to make the plants grow, they turn to studying natural cultivation.
And when a door can't be opened, they start hammering the walls.

Humans may seem dim when you watch them work, but come back a year later and you can often find them with the same goal, using a new technique.
