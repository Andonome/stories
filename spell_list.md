### Bow Snapper
    (*Conjure Fire*)

A medium-sized fire (bonfire, or larger) erupts, filling an entire room, and dealing 1D6+2 Damage to everyone inside.

### Fire-Freedom
    (*Wide Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 2, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 8 Steps, **Area:** Room, **TN:** 8

A medium-sized fire (bonfire, or larger) erupts, filling an entire room, and dealing 1D6+2 Damage to everyone inside.

Smaller fires, such as candles, or torches, still explode enough to cover the room, but deal less Damage.

## Enduring

- What the hell goes here?
- *Wall of eternal flame*?

However this works, it's important to remember one key part of the system: casters get more bang-per-buck (/ per MP) by casting low-level spells.
So a 3MP spell might cause a boat-load of Damage (1D6+3), but three 1-MP spells cause *(1D6 + 1) x 3* Damage.
