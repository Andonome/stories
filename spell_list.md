# Fire

## Big

### Flame Jump
    (*Big Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 1, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 6 Steps, **TN:** 7

A torch, candle, or bonfire jumps out to burn someone.
Bonfires deal 1D6 + 1 Damage, but smaller flames deal less.

### Fire Bolt
    (*Big Fire Duplicated*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 2, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 7 Steps, **TN:** 8

Two sparks of flame erupt around two targets.
The spark deals 2 Damage (1D6-2).

## Colourful

### Red Bull
    (*Big Colourful Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 2, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 7 Steps, **Area:** Room, **TN:** 8

A medium-sized fire (bonfire, or larger) grows into a giant red bull, the size of a room.
The caster should ensure they are not in the room when this happens.

Smaller fires, such as candles, or torches, still grow enough to cover the room, but deal less Damage.

## Twisted

### Torch Flair

    (*Twisted Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 1, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 6 Steps, **Area:** Room, **TN:** 7

A single fire burns extremely quickly.
It heats up to the point of dealing +1 Damage to anything it touches.

Within a few moments, the fire burns out.
Feeding it will not help, as it just burns through material faster.
A full house will still take some time to burn, but less than normal.

## Duplicate

### Fire-Freedom
    (*Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 2, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 8 Steps, **Area:** Room, **TN:** 8

A medium-sized fire (bonfire, or larger) erupts, filling an entire room, and dealing 1D6+2 Damage to everyone inside.
The caster should ensure they are not in the room when this happens.

Smaller fires, such as candles, or torches, still cover the room, but deal less Damage.

## Duration

### Demonic Army
    (*Big Colourful Duration (?) Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 3, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 8 Steps, **Area:** Room, **TN:** 9

A fire grows while transforming into an army of tiny impish creatures.
Anything set on fire retains this form, so clothing which catches fire will look like a small imp, biting into someone.
