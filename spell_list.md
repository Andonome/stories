#### Interrogate Flame
    (*Detect Colourful Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 2, **Skill:** Crafts, **Range:** 8 Steps, **TN:** 8

The mage asks the flame a single question about its contents, and the flame grows brighter or dimmer to answer them.

- "Have you burnt any food?"
- "Are you burning oak?"

The flame cannot answer questions pertaining to anything which it is not *currently* burning, unless the caster gives it a mind.

#### Flame Jump
    (*Alter Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 1, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 6 Steps, **TN:** 7

A torch, candle, or bonfire jumps out to burn someone.
Bonfires deal 1D6 + 1 Damage, but smaller flames deal less.

#### Fire-Freedom
    (*Alter Wide Fire*)

**Sphere:** *Fire*, **Mana:** 2, **Skill:** Projectiles, **Range:** 8 Steps, **Area:** Room, **TN:** 8

A medium-sized fire (bonfire, or larger) erupts, filling an entire room, and dealing 1D6+2 Damage to everyone inside.
The caster should ensure they are not in the room when this happens.

Smaller fires, such as candles, or torches, still cover the room, but deal less Damage.

### Enduring

- What the hell goes here?
- *Wall of eternal flame*?

However this works, it's important to remember one key part of the system: casters get more bang-per-buck (/ per MP) by casting low-level spells.
So a 3MP spell might cause a boat-load of Damage (1D6+3), but three 1-MP spells cause *(1D6 + 1) x 3* Damage.
