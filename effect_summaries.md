# Fire


## Bizarre

Fire gains unnatural properties.

0. The flame starts moving in flow motion.
1. The flame stands extremely still, or burns incredibly fast.
1. The flame becomes lightning, and arcs through any nearby water or living things.
1. Flame becomes liquid, spilling from torches, spreading over ground; or else it burns in an instant, turning its own fuel into ash in a second.
1. Flame starts burning inflammable materials, like rocks or water, but stops burning flammable ones, like wood and oil.

## Big

Changes the size of flame, according to Potency.

0. Flame the size of a candle        - 1 damage
1. Flame the size of a torch         - 2 damage
1. Flame the size of a cooking fire  - 3 damage
1. Flame the size of a bonfire       - 4 damage

## Beautiful

Aesthetic changes to colour, sound, taste, smell, and shape. Each level of Potency increases how close the result is to desired image. Inferior effect to Illusions.

0. The flame flickers to the caster's tune, dancing to music, or changing size to match a story.
1. The flame takes on the feint likeness of a face, or a silhouette.
1. Detailed likeness - the fire actually looks like someone.
1. The fire looks like a full person, or drawing, or map.
1. The fire very nearly looks like the object in question were covered in burning oil.

## Distant

0. 10 steps x MP spent
1. Throwing distance
1. Shouting distance
1. Line of sight

## Durable

Fire spells may become Durable, but that won't help the fire itself become durable.
This metamagic rarely has any effect on Fire spells, but on the rare occasions when a fire spreads and burns for a long time, whatever effects it had remain.
A fire which looks like a raging, red, bull, would normally return to a normal fire once it spreads across a town, but a *Durable, Beautiful, Fire* spell would continue looking like a beast storming across the entire town for as long as the fire lasts.
