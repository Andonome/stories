# Fire


## Bizzare

Fire gains unnatural properties.

0. The flame starts moving in flow motion.
1. The flame stands extremely still, or burns incredibly fast.
1. The flame becomes lightning, and arcs through any nearby water or living things.
1. Flame becomes liquid, spilling from torches, spreading over ground; or else it burns in an instant, turning its own fuel into ash in a second.
1. Flame starts burning inflammable materials, like rocks or water, but stops burning flammable ones, like wood and oil.

## Big

Changes the size of flame, according to Potency.

0. Flame the size of a candle        - 1 damage
1. Flame the size of a torch         - 2 damage
1. Flame the size of a cooking fire  - 3 damage
1. Flame the size of a bonfire       - 4 damage
1. Flame the size of a large tree    - 5 damage

## Beautiful

Aesthetic changes to colour, sound, taste, smell, and shape. Each level of Potency increases how close the result is to desired image. Inferior effect to Illusions.

0. The flame flickers to the caster's tune, dancing to music, or changing size to match a story.
1. The flame takes on the feint likeness of a face, or a silhouette.
1. Detailed likeness - the fire actually looks like someone.
1. The fire looks like a full person, or drawing, or map.
1. The fire very nearly looks like the object in question were covered in burning oil.

## Distant

Changes the range at which spell can affect the target. The spell misses if the range is not exact.

0. 20 steps + Potency
1. Throwing distance
1. Shouting distance
1. Line of sight

## Durable

Fire spells may become Durable, but that won't help the fire itself become durable.
This metamagic rarely has any effect on Fire spells, but on the rare occasions when a fire spreads and burns for a long time, whatever effects it had remain.
A fire which looks like a raging, red, bull, would normally return to a normal fire once it spreads across a town, but a *Durable, Beautiful, Fire* spell would continue looking like a beast storming across the entire town for as long as the fire lasts.

## Duplicated

Creates new things, or replicates existing ones. Allows spells to have more than one target. Number of targets, replicas and creations are based on Potency. Flame created fits in the plam of your hand.

0. 2 targets, 2 things created or 2 copies replicated
1. 6 targets, 6 things created or 6 copies replicated
1. 24 targets, 24 things created or 24 copies replicated

# Air

## Bizarre

Air gains unnatural properties.

0. Air becomes subtly reflective, like the shimmer on water.
1. Air becomes opaque, stopping anyone seeing through it.
1. Air becomes unbreathable, inflicting Fatigue Points on anyone inhaling it.
1. Air stifles sound.
1. Air becomes dense, and moving through it is like moving through thick molasses.

## Big

Changes the size of a mass of air. Higher Potency can increase the pressure in the room, or create gusts of wind, as air expands.

0. Air whips hair around, like a Raphaelite painting.
1. Air mass the size of a person, making movement difficult.
1. Air mass the size of a room, or a large tree, or a very large beast. Creates a gust of wind that can stagger lesser creatures, blow the (not locked or barred) door of the room open, or disperse fog.
1. Air mass the size of a house, or a field, or a grand hall. Enough wind to knock anyone nearby off their feet.
1. Air mass that fills an entire street, or most of the forest. Temporary wind speeds equal to a hurricane.

## Beautiful

Aesthetic changes to colour, sound, taste, smell, and shape. Each level of Potency increases how close the result is to desired image. Inferior effect to Illusions.

0. Child's drawing.       Fools no one, but evokes the desired image. If you tilt your head a bit, to look at a right angle
1. Kinda looks like it.   +1 to fool someone with poor eye sight, on a dark night, at a distance, while being distracted
1. Detailed likeness .    +2 to fool someone who's not paying attention
1. Almost it.             +3 to fool anyone not looking carefully
1. Near-perfect likeness  +4 to fool anyone who fails to notice the texture is wrong
