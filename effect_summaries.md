# Fire

## Bizarre

Fire gains unnatural properties.

0. The flame starts moving in flow motion.
1. The flame stands extremely still, or burns incredibly fast.
1. The flame becomes lightning, and arcs through any nearby water or living things.
1. Flame becomes liquid, spilling from torches, spreading over ground; or else it burns in an instant, turning its own fuel into ash in a second.
1. Flame starts burning inflammable materials, like rocks or water, but stops burning flammable ones, like wood and oil.

## Big

Makes flame larger.

0. Flame increases by a torchfire size.
1. Flame increases by the size of a cooking fire.
1. Flame increases by the size of a large bonfire.

## Beautiful

Aesthetic changes to colour, sound, taste, smell, and shape. Each level of Potency increases how close the result is to desired image. Inferior effect to Illusions.

0. The flame flickers to the caster's tune, dancing to music, or changing size to match a story.
1. The flame takes on the feint likeness of a face, or a silhouette.
1. Detailed likeness - the fire actually looks like someone.
1. The fire looks like a full person, or drawing, or map.
1. The fire very nearly looks like the object in question were covered in burning oil.

## Distant

Changes the range at which spell can affect the target. The spell misses if the range is not exact.

0. 10 steps x MP spent
1. Throwing distance
1. Shouting distance
1. Line of sight

## Durable

Fire spells may become Durable, but that won't help the fire itself become durable.
This metamagic rarely has any effect on Fire spells, but on the rare occasions when a fire spreads and burns for a long time, whatever effects it had remain.
A fire which looks like a raging, red, bull, would normally return to a normal fire once it spreads across a town, but a *Durable, Beautiful, Fire* spell would continue looking like a beast storming across the entire town for as long as the fire lasts.

1. The next encounter with a creature is ignored (bandits, traders, woodspies - all gone).
1. Target gets +1 to any 4 rolls (because the Potency is 4). The bonuses must be declared before rolling. This is cumulative with other Fate spells.

## Beautiful

Fate is not perceivable by most mortals. Instead, Beautiful Fate is meant to please the Gods. Pass a Int/Wit/Cha + Empathy vs Targets Cha + Potency to grant the target FP above even their maximum total. Failure results in caster losing the same amount of FP instead. FP regenerates only if below maximum total. Only the highest of multiple castings applies.

1. -2 penalty for creature to notice or work on anything unrelated to the affected idea

## Boosted

Only for the purpose of using Skills, Intelligence, Wits or Charisma are boosted, to the detriment of other two attributes. Boosted Intelligence grants extreme focus, but the character is unaware of its sorroundings and other people, suffering a penalty to Wits and Charisma. Boosted Wits grants extremely fast thinking, but the character has trouble focusing on a single idea, penalizing Intelligence, and talks too fast for other people to follow, penalizing Charisma. Boosted Charisma grants fast adaptability to any social situation, but the character becomes too self-absorbed to notice other people, or think about anything other than their social standing, penalizing Wits and Intelligence.
