# Fire


## Bizarre

Fire gains unnatural properties.

0. The flame starts moving in flow motion.
1. The flame stands extremely still, or burns incredibly fast.
1. The flame becomes lightning, and arcs through any nearby water or living things.
1. Flame becomes liquid, spilling from torches, spreading over ground; or else it burns in an instant, turning its own fuel into ash in a second.
1. Flame starts burning inflammable materials, like rocks or water, but stops burning flammable ones, like wood and oil.

## Big

Changes the size of flame, according to Potency.

0. Flame the size of a candle        - 1 damage
1. Flame the size of a torch         - 2 damage
1. Flame the size of a cooking fire  - 3 damage
1. Flame the size of a bonfire       - 4 damage
1. Flame the size of a large tree    - 5 damage

## Boosted

0. Flame burns twice the natural speed.
1. Flame burns up very fast, roaring away, and burning anyone nearby.
1. Flame reaches incredible temperatures.
1. Flame instantly atomizes its own fuel, sparking in all directions.
1. Flame disappears instantly, but too fast to go anywhere new.

## Beautiful

Aesthetic changes to colour, sound, taste, smell, and shape. Each level of Potency increases how close the result is to desired image. Inferior effect to Illusions.

0. The flame flickers to the caster's tune, dancing to music, or changing size to match a story.
1. The flame takes on the feint likeness of a face, or a silhouette.
1. Detailed likeness - the fire actually looks like someone.
1. The fire looks like a full person, or drawing, or map.
1. The fire very nearly looks like the object in question were covered in burning oil.

## Distant

Changes the range at which spell can affect the target. The spell misses if the range is not exact.

0. 10 steps x MP spent
1. Throwing distance
1. Shouting distance
1. Line of sight

## Durable

Fire spells may become Durable, but that won't help the fire itself become durable.
This metamagic rarely has any effect on Fire spells, but on the rare occasions when a fire spreads and burns for a long time, whatever effects it had remain.
A fire which looks like a raging, red, bull, would normally return to a normal fire once it spreads across a town, but a *Durable, Beautiful, Fire* spell would continue looking like a beast storming across the entire town for as long as the fire lasts.

1. Air-bubbles underwater increase in size, becoming massive.
1. Smoke grows big enough to cover a room.
1. Target smoke grows to fill a full village. Normal air still does nothing.
1. Air-pressure increases to the point of giving anyone around a headache.

1. Air mass the size of a room, or a large tree, or a very large beast.

Affected creatures lose 5 AP, minus thier Strength, and are pushed back for the same number of steps.
1. Air mass the size of a house, or a field, or a grand hall. Enough wind to knock anyone nearby off their feet. Affected creatures lose 7 AP, minus thier Strength, and are pushed back for the same number of steps.
1. Air mass that fills an entire street, or most of the forest. Temporary wind speeds equal to a hurricane. Affected creatures lose 9 AP, minus thier Strength, and are pushed back for the same number of steps.

# Fate

## Bizarre

Fate gains unnatural properties.

0. The next time the target rolls doubles on the dice (two of the same number), they gain a +1 to that Skill (not cumulative with other Fate spells).
1. The next time the target uses any Skill, they gain a +1 to that Skill, which remains as long as the spell.

1. The next encounter with a creature is ignored (bandits, traders, woodspies - all gone).
1. Target gets +1 to any 4 rolls (because the Potency is 4). This is cumulative with other Fate spells.

Fate is not perceivable by most mortals. Instead, Beautiful Fate is meant to please the Gods.

FP regenerates only if below maximum total. Only the highest of multiple castings applies.

0. Target gains 5 FP.

## Big

An existing idea becomes bigger, to the point of obsession. Target creature has to resist with Wits + Empathy vs Int/Wts/Cha + Potency, or it cannot stop thinking about this idea.

1. -2 penalty for creature to notice or work on anything unrelated to the affected idea
1. -3 penalty for creature to notice or work on anything unrelated to the affected idea
1. -4 penalty for creature to notice or work on anything unrelated to the affected idea
1. -5 penalty for creature to notice or work on anything unrelated to the affected idea

## Boosted

Only for the purpose of using Skills, Intelligence, Wits or Charisma are boosted, to the detriment of other two attributes. Boosted Intelligence grants extreme focus, but the character is unaware of its sorroundings and other people, suffering a penalty to Wits and Charisma. Boosted Wits grants extremely fast thinking, but the character has trouble focusing on a single idea, penalizing Intelligence, and talks too fast for other people to follow, penalizing Charisma. Boosted Charisma grants fast adaptability to any social situation, but the character becomes too self-absorbed to notice other people, or think about anything other than their social standing, penalizing Wits and Intelligence.

1. Target creature gains wings. Flight is possible only if Speed is higher than Strength + DR. Plants grow fast, 1 step per interval. Sorrounding ground is quickly drained of any nutrients to sustain this growth, even corpses and other plants are absorbed. Growth stops when there is nothing left to consume, but resumes as soon as new sustenance becomes available.
1. Target creature gains DR 3. -1 Dexterity penalty. The Plants become hostile to all life, and fast (for a plant). They gain total Strength, Dexterity and Speed of -1, and deal 1D6 (+ Strength) damage by smashing anything nearby with their branches.

1. Detailed likeness .    +2 to fool someone who's not paying attention
