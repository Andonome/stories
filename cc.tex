\label{raceRoll}
\label{randomCharacterCreation}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Grab $2D6$.
It's time you build some character.
Specifically, you will build your \gls{pc}.

\attributeChart

\noindent
Roll $2D6$ six times -- once for each Attribute -- and write down your result on the character sheet.
If you roll `3, 8, 9', then you have `Strength -2, Dexterity +0, Speed +1'.
Roll the dice thrice more for the Mental Attributes.

Next, roll $2D6$ to determine your character's race.

Whichever race you've landed on, go and have a look at \autoref{races} to find out about them, then come back here, and adjust your Attributes with the racial bonuses and penalties.

\input{config/rules/attributes.tex}

\subsection{Inheritance}

Each race inherits an ability.
Note the name of your ability on your character sheet.

\begin{boxtable}[lL]
  Dwarves & \nameref{dwarvenInheritance}, \autopageref{dwarvenInheritance} \\
  Elves & \nameref{elvenInheritance}, \autopageref{elvenInheritance} \\
  Gnolls & \nameref{gnollishInheritance}, \autopageref{gnollishInheritance} \\
  Gnomes & \nameref{gnomishInheritance}, \autopageref{gnomishInheritance} \\
  Humans & \nameref{humanInheritance}, \autopageref{humanInheritance} \\
\end{boxtable}

\subsection{Names}
\index{Names}
\label{randomNames}

Roll a die twice -- once for the prefix, and once for the suffix.

\subsubsection[Dwarven Names]{\Dw}
Dwarven names show to their position in society, and generally relate to their mother's occupation.

\begin{nametable}[l|XYY]{Dwarf Names}

\textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Male} & \textbf{Female} & \textbf{Mother} \\\hline
\ifodd\value{r3}
  \dicef{1}   & Strand        & Bornhardt       & Col      \\
\else
  \dicef{1}   & Bight         & Tor             & Drumlin  \\
\fi
\dicef{2}     & Dale          & Drumlin         & Esker    \\
\ifodd\value{r4}
  \dicef{3}   & Thalweg       & Glen            & Gulch    \\
  \dicef{4}   & Turlough      & Hogback         & Karst    \\
\else
  \dicef{3}   & Dell          & Maar            & Magote   \\
  \dicef{4}   & Foiba         & Mamelon         & Scree    \\
\fi
\dicef{5}     & Graben        & Morgaine        & Ridge    \\
\dicef{6}     & Sandur        & Scarp           & Strath   \\

\end{nametable}

\subsubsection[Elven Names]{\El}
Elven names represent long stretches of their lives -- generally as long as the language survives.

Roll once for the prefix, and again for a female or male suffix.

The `\"e' symbol means the sound must be pronounced fully, as in `f\textbf{ai}rie', or `sel\textbf{e}ct'.
The stress goes on the last syllable of the prefix.

\begin{nametable}[l|lYY]{Elf Names}
  & \textbf{Prefix} & \textbf{Suffix (F)}   & \textbf{Suffix (M)} \\\hline
\dicef{1} & Sind    & --\"e    & --on      \\
\dicef{2} & Atar    & --ink\"e & --inkon   \\
\dicef{3} & Ciry    & --inw\"e & --iel     \\
\dicef{4} & Tarin   & --\'ote  & --or      \\
\dicef{5} & Fin     & --uin    & --acil    \\
\ifodd\value{r3}
  \dicef{6} & It\'ar    & --w\"e   & --il      \\
\else
  \dicef{6} & Itar    & --il     & --ill\"e  \\
\fi
\end{nametable}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsubsection[Gnomish Names]{\Gn}

Roll $1D6 \times 1D6$, and re-roll on doubles to add another part to the name.

Gnomes receive names from everyone around them, so their name depends on context.
Reflexively, this therefore means they give others a name rather than asking.
However, if the gnome feels generous, and does not want to trouble any of the `big folk' with the task of creating two or three syllables, they may provide a name.

\begin{nametable}[l|Y]{Gnome Names}
1  & ni    \\
2  & lawa  \\
3  & noka  \\
4  & en    \\
5  & ante  \\
6  & alasa \\
8  & yan   \\
9  & mu    \\
10 & kala  \\
12 & yelo  \\
15 & musi  \\
16 & ma    \\
18 & leta  \\
20 & nanpa \\
24 & mute  \\
25 & wan   \\
30 & open  \\
36 & tu    \\

\end{nametable}

\end{multicols}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsubsection[Gnollish Names]{\Nl}
Gnoll names are short, to-the-point, and never require difficult lip-movements (assuming you have canine lips).
The meanings generally relate to the gnoll's primary joy, such as `hunting', or `biscuits'.

\begin{nametable}[c|lY]{Gnoll Names}
\textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Prefix} & \textbf{Suffix} \\\hline
\dicef{1}  & Ksha & --dz  \\
\dicef{2}  & Ko   & --g   \\
\dicef{3}  & Sya  & --h   \\
\dicef{4}  & Tso  & --d   \\
\dicef{5}  & Yo   & --sh  \\
\dicef{6}  & Riye & --tse \\
\end{nametable}

\end{multicols}


\subsubsection[Human Names]{\Hu}
Human names remain static throughout their lives, so they never have any relation to the person, or their accomplishments.
Humans believe that the forest takes the best part of everything, so they avoid giving their children any names which imply anything wonderful, or even positive.

\namesOfHumans

\subsection{Rank}
\label{ngRank}
\index{Rank in the \glsentrytext{guard}}
New characters start with a rank equal to the highest ranking member of the party, because life's not fair.
If everyone's new, then everyone begins as `fodder'.

\subsection{Enlistment}

\index{Concept!Random}
\label{enlistment}

Why has this character joined the \gls{guard}?
First check your `failure' -- the lowest Attribute you've rolled, and under that section check your highest Attribute.
If multiple Attributes compete for lowest or highest, stop at the first.

Write down the concept, code, stats and equipment.
